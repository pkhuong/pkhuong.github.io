  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p><small>(There were some slight edits since the original publication.
The only major change is that the time to solve each linear program
probably grows cubically, not linearly, with the number of
points.)</small></p>

<p>This should be the first part in a series of post exploring the
generation of efficient and precise polynomial approximations.  Yes,
there is Lisp code hidden in the math (: See
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex">rational-simplex</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/tree/master/demo/vanilla-fit">vanilla-fit</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the context: we want to approximate some non-trivial function,
like \(\log\), \(\exp\) or \(\sin\) on a computer, in floating
point arithmetic.  The textbook way to do this is to use a truncated
Taylor series: evaluating polynomials is pretty quick on computers.
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/blog/2011/12/21/better-function-approximations">Sam Hocevar</a>’s
post on the topic does a very good job of illustrating how
wrong-headed the approach is in most cases.  We should instead try to
find an approximation that minimises the maximal error over a range
(e.g. \([-\pi,\pi]\) for \(\sin\)).  He even has
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/oss/lolremez">LolRemez</a> to automatically
compute such approximations for given functions.  (While we’re kind of
on the topic, the very neat
<a href="http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/">Chebfun</a> applies closely-related
ideas to try and be to continuous functions what floating point
numbers are to reals.)</p>

<p>The LolRemez docs point out two clever tricks to get more efficient
approximations:
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/doc/maths/remez/tutorial-changing-variables">forcing odd or even polynomials</a>,
and
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/doc/maths/remez/tutorial-fixing-parameters">fixing parameters to simple values</a>.
Could we automate this process?</p>

<p>The goal of this series is to show that we can, by applying Operations
Research (<a href="http://www.scienceofbetter.org/">“The Science of Better”</a>)
to this micro-optimisation challenge.  OR is what I do during the day,
as a PhD student, and I believe that there’s a lot of missed
opportunities in nifty program optimisation or analysis.  (I also
think that language design has a lot to offer to OR people who cope
with modeling languages that have only changed incrementally since the
seventies. :)</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h2>

<p>For now, let’s try and solve the original problem: find, in a family
of functions \(F\) (e.g. polynomials of degree 4), an approximation
\(\tilde{f}\) of a function \(f\) over some bounded range
\(B\subset R\) such that \(\tilde{f}\) minimises the maximal error
over that range:</p>

<div>
$$\tilde{f} = \mathop{\arg\min}_{g \in F}\max_{x\in B} |g(x)-f(x)|.$$
</div>

<p>\(B\) is a dense set, with infinitely, if not uncountably, many
elements, so it’s far from obvious that we can solve this, even up to
negligible errors.</p>

<h2 id="the-remez-algorithm">The Remez algorithm</h2>

<p>The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm">Remez exchange algorithm</a>
shows one way to solve the minimax approximation problem, from the realm
of mathematical analysis.</p>

<p>Let’s pretend we do not know \(\tilde{f}\), but do know the points
where its error from \(f\) is maximised.  In fact, if we are looking
for polynomials of degree \(n\), we only need \(n+2\) such points.
Let’s further impose that the errors alternate in sign: i.e., if the
points are ordered (\(x_0 &lt; \ldots &lt; x_i &lt; \ldots &lt; x_{n+1}\)), then
\(\tilde{f}(x_0) &lt; f(x_0)\), \(\tilde{f}(x_1) &gt; f(x_1)\), etc., or
vice versa.  Nifty analysis results tell us that these points exist,
and that they exhibit the same absolute error \(|\epsilon|\).  We
can now find the coefficients \(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n\) of
\(\tilde{f}\) by solving a small linear system:</p>

<div>
$$\sum_{j=0}^n a_j x_0^j = f(x_0) + \epsilon$$
$$\sum_{j=0}^n a_j x_1^j = f(x_1) - \epsilon$$
<p><center>etc. for each \(x_i\).</center></p>
</div>

<p>There are \(n+2\) variables (the \(n+1\) coefficients \(a_j\)
and \(\epsilon\)), and \(n+2\) constraints (one for each
extremum), so it’s a straight linear solve.</p>

<p>Of course, we don’t actually know these extremal error points
\(x_i\).  The Remez algorithm works because we can initialise them
with an educated guess, find the corresponding coefficients, construct
a new approximation from these coefficients, and update (some) of the
extremal points from the new approximation.  In theory this process
converges (infinitely) toward the optimal coefficients.  In practice,
numerical issues abound: solving a linear system is usually reasonably
stable, but finding exact function extrema is quite another issue.
The upside is that smart people like
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/oss/lolremez">Sam</a> and the
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/math_toolkit/toolkit/internals2/minimax.html">boost::math team</a>
have already done the hard work for us.</p>

<h2 id="a-linear-minimax-formulation">A linear minimax formulation</h2>

<p>The minimax objective can be reformulated as an optimisation problem
over reals (or rationals, really) with linear constraints and
objective, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear program</a>:</p>
<div> $$\min_{e\in\mathbb{R}, a\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} e$$
subject to $$\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i \leq f(x) + e\qquad\forall x\in B$$
$$\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i \geq f(x) - e\qquad\forall x\in B$$ </div>

<p>In words, we’re trying to find an error value \(e\) and \(n+1\)
coefficients, such that the error \(|\tilde{f}(x)-f(x)|\quad\forall x\in
B\) is at most \(e\): \(-e \leq \tilde{f}(x)-f(x)\leq e\).  The
goal is to minimise that error value \(e\).</p>

<p>We’re still left with the issue that \(B\) is very large: infinite,
or even uncountable.  It doesn’t make sense to have two constraints
for each \(x\in B\)!  Our goal is to find approximations in floating
point arithmetic, which helps a bit: there’s actually a finite number
of floating point (single, double or otherwise) values in any range.
That number, albeit finite, still tends to be impractically large.
We’ll have to be clever and find a good-enough subset of constraints.
Note that, unlike the Remez algorithm, we can have as many constraints
as we want; we never have to remove constraints, so the quality of the
approximation can only improve.</p>

<p>This method is an interesting alternative to the Remez algorithm
because it always converges, finitely, even with (or rather, due to)
floating-point arithmetic.  It will also makes our future work on a
branch-and-cut method marginally easier.</p>

<h2 id="rational-simplex-for-exact-solutions-to-linear-programs">Rational simplex for exact solutions to linear programs</h2>

<p>We’ve reformulated our problem as a finite linear program, assuming
that we know for which point \(x\in B\) we should generate
constraints.  How can we find solutions?</p>

<p>LPs are usually solved with variants of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex algorithm</a>, a
<em>combinatorial</em> algorithm.  This is the key part: while most of the
algorithm is concerned with numerical computations (solving linear
systems, etc.), these are fed to predicates that compare values, and
the results of the comparisons drive each iteration of the algorithm.
The key insight in the simplex algorithm is that there exists at least
one optimal solution in which all but a small set of variables (the
basis) are set to zero, and the value of the basic variables can then
be deduced from the constraints.  Better: every suboptimal (but
feasible) basis can be improved by only substituting one variable in
the basis.  Thus, each iteration of the algorithm moves from one basis
to a similar, but better, one, and numerical operations only determine
whether a basis is feasible and is an improvement.  Very little
information has to persist across iterations: only the set of basic
variables.  This means that there is no inherent accumulation of
round-off errors, and that we can borrow tricks from the computational
geometry crowd.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dii.uchile.cl/~daespino">Daniel Espinoza</a> implemented
that, and much more, for his PhD thesis on exact linear and integer
program solvers.
<a href="http://www.dii.uchile.cl/~daespino/ESolver_doc/main.html">QSopt-Exact</a>
is a GPL fork of a fairly sophisticated simplex and branch and cut
program.  It exploits the fact that the simplex algorithm is
combinatorial to switch precision on the fly, using hardware floats
(single, double and long), software quad floats, multiprecision
floats, and rational arithmetic.  Unfortunately, the full solver
segfaults when reporting solution values on my linux/x86-64 machine.
Still, the individual simplex solvers (with double floats, quad
floats, multiprecision floats and rationals) work fine.  What I
decided to do was to sidestep the issue and call the solvers in
increasing order of precision, while saving the basis between calls.
The double float implementation is executed first, and when it has
converged (within epsilon), a more precise solver is called, starting
from the basis on which the previous solver converged, etc.  The final
rational solver is exact, but very slow.  Hopefully, previous solvers,
while inexact, will have converged to very nearly-optimal bases,
leaving only a couple iterations for the exact solver.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex">Rational-simplex</a> is a
one-file CL system that wraps QSopt-Exact and offers a trivial
modeling language.  We’ll use it a lot in the sequel.</p>

<h2 id="solving-the-minimax-lp-with-rational-simplex">Solving the minimax LP with rational-simplex</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/linf-fit.lisp">linf-fit.lisp</a>
implements a minimax linear fit in 60 LOC (plus a couple kLOC in QSopt
:).</p>

<p>Each
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/linf-fit.lisp#L20">point</a>
is defined by <code>loc</code>, the original value for <code>x</code>, a sequence of
parameters (in this case, powers of <code>x</code> as we’re building
polynomials), and the <code>value</code> to approximate, \(f(x)\).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/linf-fit.lisp#L41">solve-fit</a>
takes a sequence of such points, and solves the corresponding LP with
QSopt-Exact:</p>

<pre><code>(defun solve-fit (points)
  (lp:with-model (:name "linf fit" :sense :minimize)
    (let ((diff  (lp:var :name "diff" :obj 1))
          (coefs (loop for i below *dimension* collect
                       (lp:var :name (format nil "coef ~A" i)
                               :lower nil))))
      (map nil (lambda (point)
                 (let ((lhs (linexpr-dot coefs
                                         (point-parameters point)))
                       (rhs (point-value point)))
                   (lp:post&lt;= lhs (lp:+ rhs diff))
                   (lp:post&gt;= lhs (lp:- rhs diff))))
           points)
      (multiple-value-bind (status obj values)
          (lp:solve)
        (assert (eql status :optimal))
        (values obj (map 'simple-vector
                         (lambda (var)
                           (gethash var values 0))
                         coefs))))))
</code></pre>

<p>With a fresh model in scope in which the goal is to minimise the
objective function, a variable, <code>diff</code>, is created to represent the
error term \(e\), and one variable for each coefficient in the
polynomial (<code>coefs</code>) list; each coefficient is unbounded both from
below and above.</p>

<p>Then, for each point, the two corresponding constraints are added to
the current model.</p>

<p>Finally, the model is solved, and a vector of optimal coefficients is
extracted from the <code>values</code> hash table.</p>

<p>We can easily use <code>solve-fit</code> to <em>exactly</em> solve minimax instances
with a couple thousands of points in seconds:</p>

<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (let ((*dimension* 5) ; degree = 4
               (*loc-value* (lambda (x)

<p>Or, as more readable float values:</p>

<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (values (float * 1d0) (map 'simple-vector (lambda (x)
                                                     (float x 1d0))

</code></pre>

<p>So, we have an approximation that’s very close to what
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/doc/maths/remez/tutorial-exponential">LolRemez</a>
finds for \(\exp\) and degree 4.  However, we’re reporting a maximal
error of 5.466672e-4, while LolRemez finds 5.466676e-4.  Who’s wrong?</p>

<h2 id="tightening-the-model">Tightening the model</h2>

<p>As is usually the case, we’re (slightly) wrong! The complete LP
formulation has constraints for each possible argument \(x\in B\).
We only considered 4k equidistant such values in the example above.
The model we solved is missing constraints: it is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_%28approximation%29">relaxation</a>.
We’re solving that relaxation exactly, so the objective value it
reports is a lower bound on the real error, and on the real optimal
error.  At least, we don’t have any design constraint, and the
coefficients are usable directly.</p>

<p>We shall not settle for an approximate solution.  We must simply add
constraints to the model to make it closer to the real problem.</p>

<p>Obviously, adding constraints that are already satisfied by the
optimal solution to the current relaxation won’t change anything.
Adding constraints can only remove feasible solutions, and the current
optimal solution remains feasible; since it was optimal before
removing some candidates, it still is after.</p>

<p>So, we’re looking for constraints that are violated to add them to our
current model.  In the optimisation lingo, we’re doing constraint (or
row, or cut) generation.  In our problem, this means that we’re
looking for points such that the error from the current approximation
is greater than the estimate reported as our solution value.  We’ll
take a cue from the Remez algorithm and look for extremal violation
points.</p>

<p>Extrema of differentiable functions are found where the first
derivative is zero.  Our approximation function is a polynomial and is
trivially differentiated.  We’ll assume that the user provides the
derivative of the function to approximate.  The (signed) error term is
a difference of differentiable functions \(\tilde{f}-f\), and its
first derivative is simply the difference of the derivatives.</p>

<p>Assuming that the derivative is continuous, we can use the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>
to find its roots: for each root, there is a (non-empty, open)
neighbourhood such that the derivative is negative to the left of the
root and positive to the right, or inversely.</p>

<p>This is what
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/find-extrema.lisp">find-extrema.lisp</a>
implements.  In optimisation-speak, that’s our separation algorithm:
we use it to find (maximally-) violated constraints that we ought to
add to our relaxation.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/find-extrema.lisp#L71">find-root</a>
takes a function, a lower bound, and an upper bound on the root, and
first performs a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method">bisection search</a>
until the range is down to 256 distinct double values.  Then, the 256
values in the range are scanned linearly to find the minimal absolute
value.  I first tried to use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method">Newton’s method</a>, but
it doesn’t play very well with rationals: although convergence is
quick, denominators grow even more quickly.  There are also potential
issues with even slightly inexact derivatives.  This is why the final
step is a linear search.  The method will work as long as we have
correctly identified a tiny interval around the extremum; the interval
can be explored exhaustively without involving the derivative.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/find-extrema.lisp#L90">%approximation-error-extrema</a>
finds candidate ranges.  The sign of the derivative at each pair of
consecutive points currently considered in the model is examined; when
they differ, the range is passed to <code>find-root</code>.  If we find a new
extremum, it is pushed on a list.  Once all the pairs have been
examined, the maximal error is returned, along with the list of new
extrema, and the maximal distance between new extrema and the
corresponding bounds.  As the method converges, extrema should be
enclosed more and more tightly by points already considered in our
constraints.</p>

<p>There are frequent calls to
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/utility.lisp#L18">round-to-double</a>:
this function is used to take an arbitrary real, convert it to the
closest double value, and convert that value back in a rational.  The
reason we do that is that we don’t want to generate constraints that
correspond to values that cannot be represented as double floats: not
only are they superfluous, but they also tend to have large
denominators, and those really slow down the exact solver.</p>

<p>Finally, the two pieces are put together in
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/blob/master/demo/vanilla-fit/driver.lisp">driver.lisp</a>.
The constraints are initialised from 4096 equidistant points in the
range over which we optimise.  Then, for each iteration, the
relaxation is solved, new extrema are found and added to the
relaxation, until convergence.  Convergence is easy to determine: when
the error reported by the LP (the relaxation) over the constraint
subset is the same as the actual error, we are done.</p>

<p>Note that we found new extrema in the last iteration.  However, the
error for those extrema wasn’t actually larger than for the points we
were already considering, so the solution was still feasible and
optimal.</p>

<p>The fractions will be more readable in floats:</p>

<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (values (float * 1d0) (map 'simple-vector
                                    (lambda (x) (float x 1d0))

  0.177345274368841d0 0.044155517622880315d0)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have nearly exactly (up to a couple bits) the same values as
<a href="http://lol.zoy.org/wiki/doc/maths/remez/tutorial-exponential">LolRemez’s example</a>.
Each iteration takes less than 10 seconds to execute; we could easily
initialise the relaxation with even more than 4096 points.  We should
expect the impact on the solution time to be cubic: most of the
simplex iterations take place in the floating point solvers, and the
number of iterations is usually linear in the number of variables and
constraints, but the constraint matrix is dense so the complexity of
each iteration should grow almost quadratically.  What really slows
down the rational solver isn’t the number of variables or constraints,
but the size of the fractions.  On the other hand, we see that some of
the points considered by our constraints differ by \(\approx 30\)
bit in their double representation: we would need a very fine grid
(and very many points) to hit that.</p>

<p>In addition to being more easily generalised than the Remez algorithm,
the LP minimax has no convergence issue: we will always observe
monotone progress in the quality of the approximation and, except for
potential issues with the separation algorithm, we could use the
approach on any function.  There is however (in theory, at least) a
gaping hole in the program: however improbable, all the extrema could
be sandwiched between two points for which the derivative has the same
sign.  In that case, the program will finish (there are no constraint
to adjoin), but report the issue.  A finer initial grid would be one
workaround.  A better solution would be to use a more robust
root-finding algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>The minimax polynomial fitting code is on github, as a
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex/tree/master/demo/vanilla-fit">demo</a>
for the
<a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/rational-simplex">rational-simplex</a>
system.  The code can easily be adapted to any other basis (e.g. the
Fourier basis), as long as the coefficients are used linearly.</p>

<p>In the next instalment, I plan to use the cut (constraint) generation
algorithm we developed here in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut">branch-and-cut</a>
algorithm.  The new algorithm will let us handle side-constraints on
the coefficients: e.g., fix as many as possible to zero, 1, -1 or
other easy multipliers.</p>

<p>If you found the diversion in Linear programming and cut generation
interesting, that makes be very happy!  One of my great hopes is to
see programmers, particularly compiler writers, better exploit the
work we do in mathematical optimisation.  Sure, “good enough” is nice,
but wouldn’t it be better to have solutions that are provably optimal
or within a few percent of optimal?</p>

<p>If you want more of that stuff, I find that Chvatal’s book
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DN20_tW_BV0C">Linear Programming</a> is
a very nice presentation of linear programming from both the usage and
implementation points of view; in particular, it avoids the trap of
simplex tableaux, and directly exposes the meaning of the operations
(its presentation also happens to be closer to the way real solvers
work).  Works like Wolsey’s
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x7RvQgAACAAJ">Integer Programming</a>
build on the foundation of straight linear programs to tackle more
complex problems, and introduce techniques we will use (or have used)
here, like branch-and-bound or cut generation.  The classic
undergraduate-level text on operations research seems to be Hillier
and Lieberman’s
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SrfgAAAAMAAJ">Introduction to operations research</a>
(I used it, and so did my father nearly 40 years ago)… I’m not sure
that I’m a fan though.</p>
