  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p>Searching in a short, sorted vector is a fairly common task.  Lots of
time, data sets are just small enough that it’s quicker (and simpler)
to store them in a sorted vector than to use an alternative with
asymptotically faster insertions.  Even when we do use more complex
data structures, it often makes sense to specialise the leaves and
pack more data in a single node.</p>

<p>How should we implement such a search?  There are two basic options:
linear and binary search.  After running a bunch of tests, I claim
that a decent binary search offers good and robust performance, and is
nearly always the right choice.  An interpolation search could be
appropriate, but it’s a tad too complicated for short vectors, and can
fail hard if the input is arranged just wrong.</p>

<p>When the data is expected to be in cache, binary search is pretty much
always preferable.  When it isn’t, binary search is faster for short
(at most one or two cache line) and long vectors, but a good linear
search can be the best option for data that fits in a couple cache
lines.</p>

<p>I’ll focus on one specific case that is of interest to me: searching a
short or medium-length sorted vector of known size.  I’m interested in
micro-optimisations, so I’ll only work on vectors of 32-bit <code>unsigned</code>
values.  I’m also assuming we’re looking for a
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/lower_bound.html">lower bound</a>, because
that’s what I need.
Some
<a href="https://schani.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/linear-vs-binary-search/">other people</a>
have looked into this, but I consider more cases and use
size-specialised code.  I also try to represent the whole distribution
of runtimes, which helps us take long tails into account: I’m
usually willing to take a small hit in average performance for an
improvement in consistency.</p>

<h2 id="branch-mispredictions-and-entropy">Branch mispredictions and entropy</h2>

<p>X86 processors have been pipelined for quite a while now, and
(mispredicted) conditional branches are well known for wrecking the
performance of programs: when a branch is predicted wrong, all the
work that’s been speculatively done so far must be thrown out.  In
effect, the processor’s massive execution resources have then been
completely wasted from the moment the branch is decoded until it is
retired (out of order execution improves on things a bit, but the end
result is the same).</p>

<p>Of course, things aren’t as bad as they once were with the old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBurst_%28microarchitecture%29">P4</a>.
That one exhibited an awesome combination of a preternaturally long
pipeline, slow conditional moves, slow shifts, and extra latency on
any instruction that used the condition flags.  I don’t think I can
convey how frustrating that microarchitecture could be… Mispredicted
branches killed IPC, but conditional moves were only slightly better,
and more portable bit-twiddling tricks (generating masks from the sign
bit with <code>sar</code>, or from the carry flag via <code>sbb</code>) just as slow.  I
believe Linus Torvalds once posted quite the rant on that topic on
<a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/">RWT</a> (:</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="&#8220;It&#8217;s better to execute many nearly useless branches.&#8221; (!?)">
Still, I think we can tell the period has left its mark on many
programmers who will go to great lengths to avoid anything that looks
like a branch.  One
<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=184405848&amp;siteSectionName=">common</a> 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5239055/more-bit-twiddling-efficiently-implementing-a-binary-search-over-a-fixed-size-a">symptom</a> 
is the notion that it’s <em>normal</em> for a linear search to execute faster
than a binary search, even on vectors of 32 or 64 values.  The
reasoning is that the branches in a linear search are trivially
predicted: the comparison always fails, except for the very last once.
In contrast, the comparisons in a binary search are hard to predict:
there are only \(\lg n\) of them, so each one extracts one full bit
of information from the vector.  In other words, linear search is
expected to run better because each conditional extracts less
information: the predictors have less entropy to deal with, and are
right more often… “It’s better to execute many nearly useless branches.” (!?)
</span></p>

<h2 id="not-all-conditionals-are-created-equal">Not all conditionals are created equal</h2>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Fixed-length binary searches are naturally executed without any branch!">
Sometimes, it really is faster to perform redundant work to avoid
mispredicted branches.  However, that’s definitely not the 
case for linear versus binary search.  Linear search pretty much has
to be implemented with conditional branches: we really want to abort
early once we’ve found what we’re looking for.  It’s not so clear-cut
with binary search.  I think it’s a standard exercise to ask why it
doesn’t help that much to leave binary search early when we have an
exact match.  So, when the size is known ahead of time, the only
remaining conditional is when we update the upper or the
lower bound;  that’s actually a conditional move. 
Fixed-length binary searches are naturally executed without any branch! It doesn’t get more prediction-friendly than that.
</span></p>

<p>In short, we actually expect linear search to be faster than binary
search only when conditional branches allow the former to leave the
search loop early.  Linear search can hope to overtake binary search
<em>because</em> of its conditional branches!</p>

<p>I tested this hypothesis on my 2.8 GHz X5660, in GCC.  First the
linear (lower bound) search:</p>

<p>Size-specialised versions were generated by calling it with a constant
<code>size</code> argument.  GCC unrolled the loop for size 16 and lower, which
seems more than reasonable to me.  For larger sizes, the loop was not
unrolled at all.  Again, that seems reasonable: current X86 have
special logic to accelerate such tiny (compare, conditional jump,
decrement) loop bodies.</p>

<p>I assume that the size is a power of two, so I only have to track the
lower bracket of the search: the upper one is always at a known
offset.  The return value checks for a key that’s smaller than all the
elements in the vector, rather than assuming the presence of a
sentinel.  That case doesn’t happen in the tests, and the conditional 
branch is always predicted right.  I tried taking it out, and
the difference was pretty much noise, on the order of one cycle.</p>

<p>Note that other sizes could be handled by special-casing the first
iteration and setting the midpoint to <code>size - (1ul&lt;&lt;(lb(size)-1))</code>.
If the midpoint becomes the lower bound, the rest of the search is on
a power-of-two–sized range; otherwise, the sequel is performed on a
wider than necessary range, but still correct.  In both cases, the
number of iterations is the same as for a regular binary search.
There could be a slight loss of performance due to worse locality, but
the access patterns aren’t <em>that</em> different.</p>

<p>All sizes (up to 64, so six iterations) were fully unrolled.  This is
expected, as the body is a simple <code>cmp</code>/<code>lea</code>/<code>cmov</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I also tested a vectorised linear search, using SSE
instructions.  The implementations exploits vectorised comparisons to
only perform at most one test per cache line (16 values).  In fact for
vectors of length 16 or less, there is no (mispredicted) branch at
all.  The implementation is actually broken, as it performs signed
rather than unsigned comparisons, but that’s not an issue in the tests
performed here.</p>

<p>The preliminary test is always correctly predicted, and only ends up
prefetching data that’ll be used a couple instructions later.  A
similar trick as <code>TEST2</code> is used to generate a bitmask from 16
comparisons.  Finally, even when there are loops, they’re fully
unrolled.  The disassembly below shows how the conditional branch
around <code>return</code> is compiled away in the last iteration.  For all sizes
(up to 64), the loops were fully unrolled.</p>

<h2 id="graphics-time">Graphics time!</h2>

<p>The first scenario was a search for random keys on an in-cache vector.
As for all other tests, 10 000 searches were performed, and the
overhead of the benchmarking loop was estimated with the minimal
iteration time when calling an empty function (44 cycles), and
subtracted from the measured values.  Finally, extreme outliers
(values larger than the 99th percentile for each scenario, size and
algorithm) were removed.  There’s a bit of overhead (<code>rdtscp</code> isn’t
exactly lightweight), so the shorter searches don’t reveal much,
except how complex current CPUs can be.  I also tried measuring a
couple searches at a time, but that lost interesting information, and
let out of order execution mess the results up.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-07-03-binary-search-star-reduces-star-branch-mispredictions/box-random-cached.png" /></p>

<p>The graphics overlay a jittered scatter plot and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plot</a>.  The density of
points reveals how often each execution time (in clock cycle) was
observed.  The box plots give us the median and the first and third
quartiles; the median is a more robust single-number summary than the
mean on strange distributions.  Still, I also included the arithmetic
mean (without outliers) as a thin grey line.  The search algorithms
are, from left to right, forward linear search (“lin”), backward
linear search (“inv”), vectorised forward linear search (“vec”), and
binary search (“bin”).  The size of the vector is reported at the
top.</p>

<p>In general, interesting transitions will happen around length 16
(especially for forward and backward linear searches), and 32 for
binary search.  Scalar linear searches longer than 16 elements aren’t
unrolled, the vectorised search works in chunks of up to 16 elements,
and 16 <code>unsigned</code>s fit exactly in one cache line. At length 32, binary
search may access one or two cache lines, depending on the data, and
vectorised search starts executing conditional branches.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="binary search is always faster than linear search: the single mispredicted branch in the latter hurts."> 
The box plots are pretty clear.  Except for vectors of length two or four
(for which the benchmarking infrastructure probably dominates
everything), binary search is always faster than linear search: the single mispredicted branch in the latter hurts.  The
vectorised search is always a bit quicker than the scalar versions
and performs nearly identically to the binary search up
to size 16.  After that, it has to execute a few unpredictable 
branches.  The distribution of runtimes for the vectorised search
exhibits very distinct peaks, so the quartiles might not be as robust
as they usually are.
</span></p>

<p>The scatter plots are also interesting.  First, they raise an
interesting question as to what exactly is going on with the bimodal
distribution on vectors of length two or four.  I have no
clue. Current CPUs are awfully complex stateful systems with strange
interactions; I would guess a combination of back-to-back call and
return, and the benchmarking code interfering with itself.</p>

<p>Over all vector sizes, the distribution of latencies for linear
searches is distinctly multimodal: searches that end quickly execute
much faster.  The effect of batching by the cache line in the
vectorised search is also visible.  Unpredictable branches are only
executed for length 32 or 64; the median times (and spread, obviously)
then increase quite a lot.  There’s also some variation between the
forward and backward linear search; I frankly don’t know why the
access pattern has that impact, or if it might not just be noise.</p>

<p>What happens if more regular queries help eliminate branch
mispredictions?  Obviously, binary search will not be affected, but we
can expect the linear searches to execute more quickly.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-07-03-binary-search-star-reduces-star-branch-mispredictions/box-fixed-cached.png" /></p>

<p>The leftmost four plots above show what happens when the linear searches
always find the key after eight iterations (one for the vectorised
search).  The remaining two (“32*” and “64*”) instead set the key
as the very last position that is searched.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Conditional branches speed linear search up."> 
In all cases, binary search remains the same.  When the key is found
quickly (first four plots), scalar linear searches are approximately
on par with binary search, and the vectorised search faster.  On the
other hand, when the whole vector must be traversed (two rightmost
plots), the linear searches take more than thrice as much time as the
binary search! Even the vectorised search is at best comparable to the
binary search.  Comparing the top of the distribution in the first
plot to this one shows that mispredicted branches can slow linear
searches by up to 50ish cycles.  However, it is still quicker overall
to take the hit and break out of the search early: compare the
medians.  Conditional branches speed linear search up.
</span></p>

<p>The effect isn’t as marked on the vectorised search, but it’s still
slower than a binary search on the “32*” and “64*” plots.  The
branches are always predicted correctly, and we end up with a good
approximation of a fully vectorised search.  Rather than eliminating
all the branches from the vectorised linear search (by always
processing the whole vector), it’s simpler and faster to go for a
binary search.</p>

<p>Mispredictions slow linear searches down, and traversing the data
completely even more. The next plot summarises the timings for
searches that succeed after the first or second iterations of (scalar)
linear search.  That’s almost the best environment I can think of for
linear search, short of always searching for one value that’s found in
the very first iterations.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-07-03-binary-search-star-reduces-star-branch-mispredictions/box-split-cached.png" /></p>

<p>Even when they always succeed after at most two iterations, the linear
searches are only slightly faster than a binary search, with a few
very slow runs.  The vectorised search is shown in its best light: it
always succeeds on the first iteration and is, overall, comparable
with the linear searches (with a tighter spread).  Much like the
binary search, vectorising minimises branches, but does so at the cost
of additional work.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Even with very regular queries, linear searches are, at best, slightly faster than binary search, and otherwise significantly slower."> 
The “64*” plot exercises the vectorised search better: the element is
found on the third or last iteration (48th or 49th for the linear
searches).  The binary search isn’t affected at all, and the linear
searches become appreciably (by a factor of two or four) slower.  Even with very regular queries, linear searches are, at best, slightly faster than binary search, and otherwise significantly slower.
</span></p>

<p>When the data is expected to be cached, I believe it’s fair to say
that binary search should always be used instead of linear searches,
even unrolled vectorised (fully or not) versions.  In the worst
case, scalar linear searches can be more than 50 or 100 cycles slower
than a decent binary search.  In the best case, a partially vectorised
linear search can save about 10 cycles.  That sounds like a horrible
bargain.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="linear searches will eke speed-ups out by skipping some accesses, thanks to their conditional branches.">
When the data is cached, linear search only wins if we keep hammering
the same query, and it’s found in the first iterations. What if
the data isn’t cached?  I ran another set of tests, this time hopping
around 1 GB’s worth of short vectors.  The vectors were aligned to
their size, so the vectorised search worked naturally, and we can also
easily think about cache lines.  The vectors were chosen by picking
vectors in different 4 KB pages, at every potential offsets from the
start of the page, and shuffling them randomly to foil prefetching.
This is pretty much a worst-case scenario: there’s both a TLB and an
L3 miss (but the latency of a TLB miss varies a lot depending on which
parts of the page table are still cached).  I could also have tried to
use huge pages (2MB) to eliminate TLB misses.  I don’t think that’s
realistic: huge pages aren’t widely used, and TLBs misses tend
to be an issue even with working sets that are still big
enough for L2.  We can expect two things here: the timings will be
orders of magnitude slower, 
and linear searches will eke speed-ups out by skipping some accesses, thanks to their conditional branches.
</span></p>

<p>The first set of plots corresponds to random searches in out-of-cache
vectors.  Searches in even the shortest vectors are slow enough to be
somewhat meaningful.  We can observe that the latency of two accesses
to the same cache line varies a lot, from 200 to 700 cycles.  The
distributions are strongly multimodal, and it’s not clear to me that
comparing the quartiles is always useful: they sometimes fall in
nearly-empty zones between two peaks, so I would expect tiny changes
to affect them a lot.  The plots for length up to eight are all very
similar, so I’ll just drop sizes two and four in the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="In the real world, chips don&#8217;t load whole cache lines atomically.">
The forward linear searches (scalar and vectorised) are, over all,
a bit faster than the backward one.  That’s a bit counter-intuitive:
vectors of size up to 16 fit in one cache line.  That the latency from
cache misses is always the same as soon as we touch a cache line is a
useful lie: it’s usually good enough of an approximation.  In the real world, chips don’t load whole cache lines atomically.
Current sockets have hundreds of pins, but they can’t all be dedicated
to communicating with DIMMs.  On the X5660 where the tests were
executed, single-core bandwidth is 8 GB/s.  That’s exactly the
bandwidth from one of its DDR3-1066 modules.  DDR3 sends data in
chunks of 64 bits, so that’s how one cache line is loaded: 64 bits at a
time.  The CPU’s memory controller first loads the chunk corresponding
to the instruction that triggered a cache miss, and then the rest of
the cache line.  The controller simply seems to have been tuned for
programs that load data from low to high addresses.
</span></p>

<p>The binary search seems a tiny bit quicker than the other searches on
sizes up to 32, and fares badly on 64-element vectors.  16 <code>unsigned</code>s is
exactly one cache line, so it’s not surprising that 16 or fewer
(correctly aligned) elements can be binary searched quickly.  The
size-32 case benefits from an implicit data dependency in binary
search.  When the key falls in the latter half of the vector, only
that half will be read from: the initial midpoint is the first element
of that latter half.  32 <code>unsigned</code>s fit exactly in two cache lines, and
binary search thus behaves very similarly to linear searches: it reads
from only one cache line half the time, and otherwise from two.  I
can’t explain the solid peak of occurrences around 600 cycles though.
Finally, the data dependency doesn’t help so much on vectors of length
64 (half of four cache lines is still two), and binary search is then
significantly slower.</p>

<p>Some of the variation in execution times must still be caused by
branch mispredictions.  The following plots show what happens if the
key is always found after eight iterations of the scalar linear
searches (one iteration of the vectorised search).  The binary search
is also slightly advantaged on sizes 16 and up, as the key is found in
the latter half of the vector.  The rightmost two plots fix the key so
that it is found at the very last iteration of the searches, and
disadvantages binary search by searching for the minimum value in the
data.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-07-03-binary-search-star-reduces-star-branch-mispredictions/box-fixed-uncached.png" /></p>

<p>When the key is found early, the forward linear search seems a tiny
bit faster than the rest, even the vectorised search (which trades
more memory accesses for fewer branches).  Interestingly, when the key
is always found at the end, the linear searches aren’t affected that
much; speculative execution seems to be doing its job at hiding
latencies.</p>

<p>The last plots correspond to the situation when the key is found after
one or two iterations (equiprobably) for the linear searches (one for
the vectorised version, and in the last cache line for binary search).
The “64*” column shows the latencies for a worse scenario: the key is
found after 48 or 49 iterations of the linear searches (three or four
for the vectorised search), and in the first quarter of data for
binary search.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-07-03-binary-search-star-reduces-star-branch-mispredictions/box-split-uncached.png" /></p>

<p>On the good cases, all searches seem to be doing similarly, except for
vectors of length 64 (on which the binary search really suffers).  In
fact, comparing the “64” and “64*” plots reveals that binary search
is affected by variations in the query just as much as linear
searches: bad memory access patterns can hurt a lot more than
mispredicted branches.</p>

<p>In the end it looks like all searches behave pretty much the same when
searching uncached vectors spanning at most two cache lines.  After
that, linear searches have better access patterns (and after that,
asymptotics catch up).</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="Linear search should only be used when it&#8217;s expected to bail out quickly.">
When performance matters, linear search shouldn’t be preferred to
binary search to minimise branch mispredictions.  Linear search should only be used when it’s expected to bail out quickly.
The situations in which that property is most useful involve
uncached, medium-size vectors.  In general, I’d just stick to binary
search: it’s easy to get good and consistent performance from a
simple, portable implementation.
</span></p>

<p>In some cases, it might be worth the trouble to go for a
heroically optimised linear search, but maintenance may be a bitch.
If I expected to be working with larger, potentially uncached,
datasets, I’d instead try to exploit caches more smartly… But that’s a
topic for another post!</p>

<p>A friend of mine pointed out one case when a fully vectorised linear
search, without early exit, may be the only (high-performance) option:
cryptographic code.  When the data isn’t cached, even binary search
can leak some information, via the number of distinct cache lines that
are accessed.</p>

<p>I also completely ignored the question of shared resources (memory
channels, particularly) on multicore chips: what happens to throughput
when multiple cores are executing that kind of search workload?  I’ll
probably leave that to someone else ;)</p>
