<!--l. 11--><p style="text-indent:0em">In <a href="http://www.pvk.ca/Blog/Coding/deadline-vs-timeout.html">the last post</a>, I advocated the use and design of blocking interfaces based on
deadlines rather than timeouts. I finally found the POSIX snippet that I was
thinking of: it&#8217;s in the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_cond_wait.html#tag_03_518_08_02">specification for <code style="font-family:monospace">pthread_cond_timedwait</code></a>. The post also got
me two very interesting comments.
</p><!--l. 19--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   One reader noted that they had had a lot more trouble understanding and fixing
performance issues in a highly-threaded program when they used deadlines instead of
timeouts. I suppose that using deadlines based on something like wallclock-time can
introduce yet another variable in an already hard-to-understand system. In the end, I
still feel that&#8217;s more than outweighed by the consistency with respect to the rest of
the world, especially given that timeouts can be constructed so easily on top of
deadlines.
</p><!--l. 28--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Another raised an important issue: which time should our deadlines be based on?
The regular system clock, like UTC time, is affected by many events like leap
seconds, ntp drift, the user changing the time to fool Farmville, &#8230;. In fact, it&#8217;s not
even guaranteed to be monotonic: the system time can be moved backward. (Bonus
points if you can determine how hardware suspend should be detected and/or
handled.)
</p><!--l. 36--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Of course, timeouts share all issues regarding nonmonotonic clocks, but I suppose
most of us don&#8217;t think about it. POSIX usually specifies that timeouts must ignore
time adjustments, or at least, backward ones, and linux/glibc seem to mostly achieve
that by using a monotonic clock; it&#8217;s not clear how a portable program can achieve
the same effect, though.
</p><!--l. 44--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   <a href="http://blog.habets.pp.se/2010/09/gettimeofday-should-never-be-used-to-measure-time">This blog post</a> has an interesting overview of the issue, and a list of buggy
programs and APIs that misuse wall-clock time.
</p><!--l. 47--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The realtime POSIX extension includes a partial solution to this non-monotonic
clock issue: <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/clock_getres.html"><code style="font-family:monospace">clock_gettime</code></a>, along with <code style="font-family:monospace">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code>, gives access to time values
that never go backward. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not always available (in particular, it&#8217;s
absent on Solaris, OS X and Windows); the author of the previously-mentioned
blog post also has <a href="https://github.com/ThomasHabets/monotonic_clock">a tiny portability wrapper</a> to provide such time values on
POSIX platforms with <code style="font-family:monospace">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code>, and on Solaris and OS X as well.
Still, platforms without <code style="font-family:monospace">clock_gettime </code>don&#8217;t necessarily expose blocking
calls with deadlines based on a monotonic clock either (e.g. OS X doesn&#8217;t
have one for its Mach semaphores), so only having a sane clock isn&#8217;t <em style="font-style:italic">that</em>
useful.
</p><!--l. 62--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   This isn&#8217;t only a theoretical or highly-improbable issue either; SBCL has had a
bug caused by timeouts for quite a while. The internals include this function, which
resumes <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep</code>ing when interrupted by signal handling.

<!--l. 89--><p style="text-indent:0em">
</p><!--l. 91--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   On OS X, when <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep </code>is interrupted by a signal, the second argument is
updated by computing the time remaining in the timeout, once the signal handler
returns. Of course, that leads to an interesting situation when the subtracted time is
greater than the time to <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep </code>for (e.g. a signal handler consumes two seconds
before returning to a 1-second <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep</code>): the &#8220;remaining&#8221; timeout underflows into
a very long timeout.
</p><!--l. 99--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Other platforms only subtract the time elapsed from the execution of
<code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep </code>until the signal is received. At least, there&#8217;s never any underflow in
the &#8220;remaining&#8221; timeout, but that value, while always sane, is still pretty
much useless. If the loop is executed 5 times (i.e. <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep </code>is interrupted 5
times), and each signal takes 1 second to handle, the function be 5 second
late.
</p><!--l. 106--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   So, outside OS X, the &#8220;remaining&#8221; timeout computed by <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep </code>is subtly
useless. On OS X, it&#8217;s only even more subtly useless: we have the same problem when
a signal hits us between two calls to <code style="font-family:monospace">nanosleep</code>.
</p><!--l. 111--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   POSIX recommends the use of <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/clock_nanosleep.html"><code style="font-family:monospace">clock_nanosleep</code></a> if the issue above with
interruptions matters. In addition to being based on a deadline rather than a
timeout, it lets us specify which clock the deadline is based on. As usual, that&#8217;s not
                                                                  

                                                                  
available everywhere, so we&#8217;ll likely be stuck with a hard-to-trigger race condition in
<code style="font-family:monospace">SLEEP </code>on some platforms. </p>
