        <h3>Introducing Pipes, a lightweight stream fusion EDSL</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">

<!--l. 6--><p style="text-indent:0em">Fusion is cool. It lets us write bulk data processing programs modularly, with each
pass or computation separate from the rest, while retaining the efficiency of
code that executes all the passes simultaneously rather than building large
intermediate values. In the last couple years, most of the attention has been
coming from the Haskell crowd (e.g. <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/streams.html">Data.List.Stream</a>), but Lisper aren&#8217;t
immune to that siren&#8217;s call. In the late 80&#8217;s, Richard Waters worked on
<a href="http://series.sourceforge.net/">SERIES</a>, a Common Lisp package to transform &#8220;obviously synchronizable series
expressions&#8221; into buffer-less loops. That package is still available, and even lightly
maintained.
</p><!--l. 20--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   I believe that, while the goal is noble, the approach taken in SERIES is too
magical; I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s even more true of stream fusion in GHC.
</p><!--l. 24--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   SERIES goes through a lot of trouble to makes it transformation work on code
expressed as regular CL, and even across function definitions. The problem is,
SERIES can only handle a subset of CL, so users can be surprised when a seemingly
minor refactoring suddenly breaks their code.
</p><!--l. 30--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   GHC&#8217;s fusion stuff has the virtue of using the language itself to handle the dirty
work of looking just like regular Haskell. Unfortunately, it also depends on
inlining and on rewrite rules (well, one), which don&#8217;t warn when they can&#8217;t be
applied.
</p><!--l. 35--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   So, instead, I believe that we should be using an EDSL. It&#8217;s embedded, so it&#8217;s
easy to use with the host language (both around and inside the DSL). It&#8217;s also
domain specific, so it should be clear what the language does and doesn&#8217;t handle,
and, in the worst case, the implementation can warn the user instead of silently
reverting to slowness.
</p><!--l. 42--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The design space is huge, but I think <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/Pipes">Pipes</a> is a decent point. I haven&#8217;t been able
to spend even one minute on it since a hackathon during the holidays; I hope
someone else will be able to work on Pipes a bit.
</p>
   <h3><a id="x1-1000"></a>The idea behing Pipes</h3>
<!--l. 49--><p style="text-indent:0em">The simplest fusion schemes attempt to handle cases like
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p>
   <pre style="white-space:pre; clear:both; font-family:monospace; text-align:left" align="left">(mapcar f (mapcar g list)) -&gt; (mapcar (compose f g) list)</pre>
<!--l. 52--><p style="text-indent:0em">
</p><!--l. 54--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   These cases are simple because each operation has at most one consumer (output)
and one producer (input), and produces exactly one output value for each input
value. The obvious ways to generalize allow arbitrarily many output values per input
values, multiple consumers, or multiple producers.
</p><!--l. 60--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Most common are transformations that handle an arbitrary number of output
values per input values (or even arbitrary types!). <code style="font-family:monospace">foldr </code>fusion is probably the prime
example. I like to think of these rules as based on a specialised CPS conversion:
instead of consing a list up, producers call their continuations on each item that
would have been in that list.
</p><!--l. 67--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   I&#8217;m not sure I can find examples of schemes that handle multiple consumers in the
literature. We don&#8217;t see them as often in code as multiple producers, and they&#8217;re
hard to handle with rewrite rules. Still, it&#8217;s not hard to treat those cases with
a dedicated code generator: just compile a &#8220;push&#8221; dataflow engine. Such
a compiler could easily be extended to allow many outputs (or none) per
input.
</p><!--l. 74--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Multiple producers are much more common, if only because <code style="font-family:monospace">zipWith </code>is a
standard list operation. Stream fusion achieves that, and a lot more: concatenated
and nested streams, mostly. It can also handle functions like <code style="font-family:monospace">filter </code>easily, by
inserting &#8220;skip&#8221; values in the stream. In fact, it can allow functions to yield an
arbitrary number of output values per input. That&#8217;s compatible with what a &#8220;pull&#8221;
dataflow engine can achieve.
</p><!--l. 82--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   SERIES is somewhere else in the solution space. It allows multiple producers and
consumers, but not, as far as I can tell, more than one output per input (it too uses
&#8220;skip&#8221; values to implement functions like <code style="font-family:monospace">filter</code>). It achieves that by compiling to a
loop that advances the state of each node in the dataflow graph exactly once per
iteration. Thus, the amount of implicit buffering is constant (one output value for
each node), and the loop&#8217;s body is generated by a simple traversal of the
graph.
</p><!--l. 91--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Pipes is mostly a &#8220;push&#8221; engine that handles multiple consumers, but uses a type
system to recognize cases similar to what SERIES handles, and then allows multiple
producers as well. It&#8217;s a different design choice than stream fusion, but I believe
that it&#8217;s essential to allow multiple consumers instead of forcing users to
build temporary values <em style="font-style:italic">and then traverse them multiple times</em>. Like SERIES,
it compiles to a loop whose body corresponds to a traversal of the graph.
However, instead of advancing each node exactly once per iteration, some
subgraphs can advance multiple times per iteration, or even compile to nested
loops.
</p><!--l. 102--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   I&#8217;ve been trying to find a good tradeoff for almost 5 years now, and it I feels like
there&#8217;s a rule here, something like &#8220;arbitrary outputs per input, multiple consumers,
                                                                  

                                                                  
multiple producers: choose two.&#8221; Stream fusion chooses multiple producers and
arbitrary output, SERIES multiple producers and consumers, and Pipes multiple
consumers and arbitrary output, plus a dash of multiple producers in certain cases.
The fact that it almost manages to get that third feature is what I originally found
exciting about that design.

   <h3><a id="x1-2000"></a>That&#8217;s it for now</h3>
<!--l. 112--><p style="text-indent:0em">Frankly, I&#8217;m pretty much rediscovering my own code, but I remember thinking that it
was almost ready for people to start playing with it. Again, it can be downloaded at
