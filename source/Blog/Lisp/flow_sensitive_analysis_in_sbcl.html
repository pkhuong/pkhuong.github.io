<!--l. 11--><p style="text-indent:0em">As I noted <a href="http://www.pvk.ca/Blog/Lisp/constraint-sets.html">a year and a half ago</a>, the constraint propagation pass in SBCL can slow
compilation down a lot (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/394206">lp#394206</a>, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/792363">lp#792363</a>). To a large extent, I feel like that
issue has been fixed in HEAD, but the lack of documentation on that pass made
progress slower than it could have been. So, this post is a half-organised version of
my notes, before I forget it all.

   <h3><span>1   </span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>What constraint propagation does</h3>
<!--l. 22--><p style="text-indent:0em">The constraint propagation pass is executed as part of the <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/main.lisp;h=84bfea7f25b3b33eee7be2a52a564de46e168c8d;hb=HEAD#l469">IR1 optimisation loop</a>,
which operates on Lisp-level basic blocks. It&#8217;s only concerned with propagating
information between &#8220;real&#8221; variables (<a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l1095">LAMBDA-VARiable</a>), variables that have a
name and can be set and referred to multiple times, as opposed to temporaries
(<a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l58">LVARs</a>).
</p><!--l. 31--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The distinction is useful because there are (usually) much fewer full-blown
variables than temporaries, and only the former directly benefit from exploiting
previously executed type checks and predicates to deduct information (flow
sensitivity).
</p><!--l. 36--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Instead of handling all the operation found in basic blocks, constraint propagation
only consider a few key operations, and otherwise exploits the type information
previously derived in a bottom-up manner (i.e. propagating the types of arguments
to result types) by the other IR1 passes. The latter, inversely, only have access to the
results of constraint propagation through the type derived for each <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l1177">REFerence</a> to a
lambda-var.
</p><!--l. 46--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   So, constraint propagation goes through each basic block, updating its state (set
of known true constraints) when it encounters <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l1289">BIND</a> nodes (LET bindings, more or
less), references to a lambda-var, <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l1322">CAST</a> nodes ([usually] checked type assertions),
<a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/node.lisp;h=69bc2959197ca7ea5446a233580923e72f9324b4;hb=HEAD#l1218">CSET</a> nodes (assignment), or branches on a few key predicates (EQL, <em style="font-style:italic">&lt;</em>, <em style="font-style:italic">&gt; </em>or
TYPEP, mostly).
</p><!--l. 56--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   As would be expected, the state at the end of each basic block is propagated to its
successors, join points take the intersection of their precedessors&#8217; states, and entry
points are initialised with empty states... and this is all executed iteratively until
convergence.

</p>
   <h3><span>2   </span> <a id="x1-20002"></a>What constraint propagation isn&#8217;t</h3>
<!--l. 63--><p style="text-indent:0em">It <em style="font-style:italic">feels </em>a lot like an abstract interpretation algorithm. However, a major difference is
that constraint propagation doesn&#8217;t converge on a <em style="font-style:italic">least </em>fixed point. Take the
following trivial example:

(FUNCTION NIL (VALUES NUMBER &amp;OPTIONAL))</pre>
<!--l. 76--><p style="text-indent:0em">
</p><!--l. 78--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   It&#8217;s obvious to us that <code style="font-family:monospace">X </code>will always be a single float. Unfortunately, while SBCL&#8217;s
type analyses converge to a fixed point, they&#8217;re not always seeded with an
underapproximation of a least fixed point.
</p><!--l. 83--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   When there are assignments to a variable, the type of that variable is initialised
with its declared type (T if none), and, after that initial type has been used to
derive the type of the values that could be assigned to it, the union of these
types is taken (and of the initially bound value). In the example above,
the return type of <code style="font-family:monospace">(/ [T] [single-float]) </code>is <code style="font-family:monospace">NUMBER</code>. Once we have an
over-approximation of the least fixed point, we shouldn&#8217;t expect to tighten it back
much.
</p><!--l. 92--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   In a proper abstract interpretation pass, <code style="font-family:monospace">X </code>would be initialised with the bottom
type or the singleton type <code style="font-family:monospace">(EQL 0.0) </code>(or some approximation thereof), and
iteratively widened with the derived type of the division and of its initialisation
value, up to convergence. That would easily deduce that <code style="font-family:monospace">X </code>is always 0.0, or, at least,
a single-float.
</p><!--l. 99--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   It&#8217;s also not like any SSA variant. Yes, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.3.6773">Continuation-passing Style is equivalent to
Static single assignment form</a>. One key part of that equivalence is that both styles
rename variables at join points (via arguments to the continuation or phi functions).
IR1 does mention continuations, but these continuations don&#8217;t perform the essential
renaming of variables. That is the very reason why we have to use constraint sets
to represent what we know about a variable&#8217;s contents <em style="font-style:italic">at a given program</em>
<em style="font-style:italic">point</em>.

   <h4><span>3.1   </span> <a id="x1-40003.1"></a>Constraints</h4>
<!--l. 111--><p style="text-indent:0em">At the heart of the pass are constraint sets (<a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD#l134">CONSETs</a>) that are updated as the
analysis walks through a basic block. Each <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD#l56">constraint</a> in a conset represent a small
fact that is known to be true about a given lambda-var: that its contents are (or are
not) of a certain type, are greater or less than values of a given type, EQL to a
constant, or EQL to another variable.
</p><!--l. 120--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   As a pun, EQL constraint can also link a lambda-var and an lvar: as combinations
(function calls) work with lvars, these special constraints are used to translate
information about a combination&#8217;s arguments to information about lambda-vars
(which is what constraint propagation handles).
</p><!--l. 126--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   EQL constraints are special. When two variables are EQL, it&#8217;s essential for good
performance to extend that EQLness to all the variables that are EQL to either of
them (i.e. compute the transitive closure of the EQL relation). This is useful because,
when something is true of a variable (e.g. it&#8217;s TYPEP FIXNUM), it&#8217;s also true of all
the variables EQL to it.
</p><!--l. 133--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   However, we only do that for one of the operands in a non-EQL constraint
between variables, and not at all for EQL constraints involving constants (overly
eager constant propagation can hurt since our codegen doesn&#8217;t handle repeated
references to constraints that well) or lvars (these aren&#8217;t really constraints, but rather
pure bookkeeping information punned as constraints).

know nothing about the inputs), and the consets are updated by walking down the

     <ul><li>BIND nodes represent things like LET bindings. If we have a useful (more
     precise than T) type for the bound value, the new variable is (currently)
     of that type. Also, if the bound value is a lambda-var&#8217;s current value, then
     the newly introduced variable is EQL to it.
     </li>
     <li>REF nodes are references to a lambda-var. The LVAR that receives that
     value is EQL to the lambda-var. Additionally, if we&#8217;re on the last iteration,
     it&#8217;s useful to store all that we know about the referenced variable at that
     program point for other IR1 passes to exploit.
     </li>
     <li>CAST nodes are type checks. If the check fails, execution will not continue,
     so we can simply assume that the check is successful, and propagate the
     type to the lambda-var at the end of the chain of casts (if any).
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li>CSET nodes represent assignments. The most important thing to do is
     forget all that is known about the assigned variable at that program point:
     after the assignment, it&#8217;s bound to a brand new value. Still, before that,
     if we want a lot of propagation, it&#8217;s useful to propagate some information
     that&#8217;s always true of that variable to EQL nodes. For now, it only makes
     sense to propagate the fact that, if the assigned variable is known to always
     be of a given type, all the variables that are currently EQL to it are
     also of that type. Then, as with bind nodes, it&#8217;s useful sense to add type
     constraints from the new value, and to add EQL constraints if applicable.</li></ul><!--l. 174--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Finally, if the block ends with a conditional branch, it&#8217;s useful to look at the
predicate guiding the branch to propagate different constraints to the consequent and
alternative successors.
</p><!--l. 178--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   If the predicate is simply a reference to a variable, then it&#8217;s known to be NIL in
the alternative, and something else in the consequent.
</p><!--l. 181--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   If it&#8217;s a function call, only a few functions are interpreted: </p>
     <ul><li>TYPEP-like  functions  result  in  constraints  to  the  effect  that  a  given
     lambda-var is or is not of a given type.
     </li>
     <li>EQ and EQL result in additional EQL constraints (between variables, or
     to a constant) in the consequent, and the reverse constraints (not EQL)
     in the alternative
     </li>
     <li><em style="font-style:italic">&lt; </em>and <em style="font-style:italic">&gt; </em>are used to derive tighter bounds on numeric types. However,
     we do not track relationships between variables (except for EQLity and
     non-EQLity), and only note that a given variable is less or greater than a
     value of some type.
     </li>
     <li>A  few  other  type  predicates  also  result  in  TYPEP  constraints,  when
     specially marked for the compiler.</li></ul><!--l. 196--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Once a basic block has been constraint propagated through, the information is
used by its successors. Basic blocks are processed in such an order that at least one of
its predecessors have been propagated through before itself. The analysis is run with
an initial conset made of the intersection of the consets (that have already been
computed) at the end of its predecessors, taking care to use the right one if some
predecessor ends in a conditional branch (<a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD#l1051">COMPUTE-BLOCK-IN</a>). And, that&#8217;s
repeated on blocks for which the initial conset might have changed until we hit a
fixed point.
</p><!--l. 207--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Once that&#8217;s done, we&#8217;re only interested in storing all the flow-sensitive
information we have about each variable in the relevant REFerences to it. So,
constraint propagation is executed one last time (otherwise we only have the consets
                                                                  

                                                                  
at the beginning and end of each basic block), and, when a ref node is encountered,
the set of constraints related to the referenced variables is extracted and converted
into a type, in <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD#l803">CONSTRAIN-REF-TYPE</a>.

   <h3><span>4   </span> <a id="x1-60004"></a>What&#8217;s been and what could be done</h3>
<!--l. 217--><p style="text-indent:0em">We currently represent consets as bitsets. Without too much surprise, the only
operation that is horrible with bitsets is iterating through the members of a given set.
Fortunately, we only used this in a few functions, and it seems like bitsets are still the
best option, when supplemented with a few indices.
</p><!--l. 223--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The heaviest timesink was <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD#l292">FIND-CONSTRAINT</a>: constraints are hash-consed so
that equivalent constraints are always EQ. It used to be we&#8217;d perform a linear
search over the set of constraints associated with a given variable to find
constraints. We now use hash tables in each variable to speed the search
up.
</p><!--l. 230--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The other major slowdowns were related to functions that need to iterate through
the intersection of the current set of constraints and certain subsets of the constraints
associated with a given variable (e.g. all the EQL constraints for a given variable in
the current constraint set). Instead of iterating through the intersection of two
bitvectors, we represent each subset of the constraints associated with each variable
as vectors of constraints (the hash-consing step already ensures there won&#8217;t be any
duplicate). Now, we only have to iterate through these vectors and check for
membership in a bitset.
</p><!--l. 240--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   These simple changes are enough to bring compile times for a couple test cases
down from hundreds of seconds to a few seconds or less.
</p><!--l. 243--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   There are definitely more low-hanging fruits in this area, be it for more precise
analyses (converging to a proper least fixed point), stronger interaction with the rest
of the IR1 passes or quicker compilation. Hopefully, this post can serve as
a high level guide to would-be <a href="http://sbcl.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sbcl/sbcl.git;a=blob;f=src/compiler/constraint.lisp;h=5056510d55b4756b01c393820dce424557bf928a;hb=HEAD"><code style="font-family:monospace">src/compiler/constraint.lisp</code></a> hackers.
