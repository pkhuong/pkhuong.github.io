<p>(Thank you xkcd)</p>

<p>Common Lisp isn't one of them scripting languages in which lists have
O(1) random dereferencing or arrays O(1) insertion at both ends, but
it's still possible to forget about invisible costs.</p>

<p>Still on the topic of random shuffling, <a href="http://blog.viridian-project.de/2008/04/06/sequence-shuffling-revisited/">Leslie Polzer</a> lists three
alternatives, and suggests another, one that feels like a &quot;Good
Solution&quot;. Unfortunately, the only one not to work is the latter.</p>

<p>It seems to me the best solution is the one that looks the worst to
some. Fisher-Yates is a nice, simple shuffling algorithm. It could
have been cuter, but I don't see what's wrong with imperative code.</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun fisher-yates (sequence)
  (let ((vector (coerce sequence 'vector)))
    (loop for i downfrom (1- (length vector)) to 0
          do (rotatef (aref vector i)
                      (aref vector (random (1+ i)))))
    (replace sequence vector)))
</pre>

<p>The other sort-based solutions also work, except the final cleverer
one that uses memoisation. It <em>looks</em> good. Unfortunately, it's not
thread-safe and, contrary to the advertisement, it conses (probably
more so than the other implementations). Worse, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>It's obviously not thread-safe, since each call to <code>seqrnd</code>
reinitialises the global memoisation table. A better solution would
use dynamic scoping instead of assignment. If the code isn't meant to
be used in a threaded environment, then <code>CLRHASH</code> would probably be a
better idea.</p>

<p>Generic memoisation is often based on a hash table. Such a table must
save the key-value association somewhere. It needs at least two words
for the key and the value. Usually, the overhead is greater than that,
for various implementation-level reasons. Compare that to the
solutions that sort a sequence of conses: with a vector, the space
overhead's usually a bit more than 3 words/value (4 for a
list). Specialised data structures can often bring the cost down, by
being lossy or using some attribute of the set of
associations. Generic memoisation is a nice hack, but is often
replaced by specialised code as development goes on.</p>

<p>The shuffling code also does not work. A memoisation table will
associate random numbers to values, not (initial) positions. If the
sequence to shuffle contains the same element several times, all the
references/copies will be bundled sequentially! For
example, the list <code>(a a b b)</code> can only be shuffled two ways: <code>(a a b b)</code>
or <code>(b b a a)</code>. There are also issues with numbers and characters, for
which <code>EQ</code> is free to return <code>NIL</code> regardless of the arguments, but that's
not exactly common.</p>

<p>(Mis)Using existing code is a very good idea, especially for quick
hacks or boilerplate that's only in the way of the essence of a
project. However, it's still important to be aware of what's going on
underneath it all. Excessive use of opaque magic leads to beautiful
broken code.</p>

<p>Extra! Extra! We can abuse CLISP's arbitrary precision floats to
generate a lot of digits of Pi for us:</p>

<pre class="example">
[1]&gt; (setf (long-float-digits) 3500)
3500
[2]&gt; (* 4 (atan 1L0))
3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419...
