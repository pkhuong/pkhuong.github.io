I don't really follow the compression scene, and only pay minimal
attention to machine learning.  Nevertheless, the "Compression is
Learning" slogan feels more and more right to me.  In this post, I'll
explore another relationship that I find surprising: one between
compression and compilation.

Five years ago, I took Marc Feeley's compiler class, and he let us
choose our term project.  I settled on generating traces from
recursive algorithms (typical of cache-oblivious algorithms) and
[reordering them to get iterative code](http://discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/ift6232/)
that was better suited to the first level of cache.  I came up with a
gnarly CL-accented research-quality prototype, but the result was
surprisingly effective.  Sadly, I never really managed to recover
loops or function calls from the fully inlined trace, so even
medium-size kernels would exhaust the instruction cache.

I believe I now see a practical and scalable solution, thanks to Artur
Jez's work on
["A really simple approximation of smallest grammar."](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4445)
His work might lead to a function-oriented analogue of trace
compilation.  Trace compilers are notoriously weak on recursion
(recursive function calls don't map well to loops), so it would be
nifty to have an alternative that identifies functions rather than
loops.

This makes me quip that "(Trace) Compilation is Compression."  We
can see trace compilers as lazily unpacking traces from the source
program, rewriting them a bit, and recompressing traces in an
executable format.  Admittedly, the analogy is a bit of a stretch for
classical compilers: they are less aggressive in decompressing source
code and directly translate from one compressed representation (a
small source file may describe billions of execution paths) to
another.

Anywayâ€¦ this is extremely hypothetical and Jez's work is fun
independently of my weekend speculations.

How to fail with LZ77
=====================

Once we cast a program trace as a sequence of opcodes (perhaps
without operands, to expose more redundancy), it's obvious that
reducing code size is "just" compression, and
[LZ-type algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78)
quickly come to mind: they compress strings by referring to earlier
substrings.

The heart of LZ77 is a loop that streams through the input sequence
and finds the longest common subsequence earlier in the input.  In
practice, the search usually considers a fixed-size window; when I
write LZ77 here, I instead refer to the theoretical approach with an
unbounded search window.  Repeated LCS searches on an unbounded window
sounds slow, but, in sophisticated implementations, the bottleneck is
sorting the input string to generate a suffix array.

I don't feel like being sophisticated and will implement a
quadratic-time LCS search.

{% codeblock %}
(defun longest-subseq (seq start)
  "Find the longest subseq of seq[start...] that begins before start."
  (let ((best 1)
        (index nil))
    (dotimes (i start (values index best))
      (let ((length (mismatch seq seq :start1 i :start2 start
                                      :test #'equal)))
        (assert length)
        (decf length i)
        (when (> length best)
          (setf best length
                index i))))))
{% endcodeblock %}

Some backreferences clearly look like function calls.
{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (longest-subseq "abab" 0)
NIL ; There is no match to the left of abab
1   ;                                  ^
CL-USER> (longest-subseq "abab" 2)
0   ; There is a match for the second ab, starting
2   ; at index 0 and spanning 2 characters.
{% endcodeblock %}

It's a bit surprising at first, but some also correspond to `repeat` loops.
{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (longest-subseq "abababa" 2)
0 ; There is a match for "ababa", starting
5 ; at index 0 and spanning 5 characters.
{% endcodeblock %}

This last patch is strange because it's self-referential.  However, if
we decompress character by character, its meaning becomes obvious: we
replicate the substring in `[0, 1]` to generate exactly 5 characters.
This is basically a loop; we can handle partial copies with, e.g.,
rotation and entering the middle of the loop (like Duff's device).

Lempel and Ziv's result tells us that we can look for references
greedily in an unbounded window and obtain asymptotically optimal
(proportional to the string's entropy) compression.  Again, there are
algorithms to do that in linear time -- via radix sort -- but I'll just
bruteforce my way in cubic time.

{% codeblock %}
(defstruct factor start length subseq)

(defun factorise (seq)
  (let ((index 0)
        (length (length seq)))
    (loop while (< index length)
          collect
          (multiple-value-bind (start length)
              (longest-subseq seq index)
            (prog1
                (if (null start)
                    (elt seq index)
                    (make-factor :start start :length length
                                 :subseq (subseq seq start (+ start length))))
              (incf index length))))))
{% endcodeblock %}

Here's the problem with converting an LZ77 factorisation into calls and
loops: there is no guarantee that patches nest sanely.

{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (factorise "ababac||bac")
(#\a #\b #S(FACTOR :START 0 :LENGTH 3 :SUBSEQ "aba") #\c #\| #\|
 #S(FACTOR :START 3 :LENGTH 3 :SUBSEQ "bac"))
{% endcodeblock %}

This factorisation encodes "ababac||bac" by repeating "ab" two and a
half times, inserting "c||", and then repeating "bac."  The issue is
that we wish to convert "ababa" into a loop, but the last patch would
then need to enter that loop in its last iteration.  We could also
have the opposite problem, with a patch that only covers a prefix of
an earlier patch (a few iterations of a loop).  The sketch below shows
how we might even have to deal with both issues in the same factor.

Jez's solution
==============

[Jez's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4445) analyses a method to
recover a CFL with a single member, the string we wish to compress.
The CFL is described by a fully deterministic (it produces exactly one
string) CFG in Chomsky normal form, i.e., a straight-line program.

This "really simple" approach takes a step back from LZ compression
and instead starts with the easiest, greedy, way to generate a
straight-line program from a string: just pair characters as you
encounter them, left-to-right.

For example, on "abab," this would pair "(ab)(ab)" and then
"((ab)(ab))," and generate the following grammar:

    G -> XX
    X -> ab

We got lucky: the repetition synced up with the greedy pairing.
That's not always the case; for example, "abcab" becomes "(ab)(ca)b" -- which
exposes no redundancy -- rather than "(ab)c(ab)."

Jez addresses this issue by using LZ77 factorisation as an oracle to
synchronise pairings.

First, we simplify the algorithm by assuming that there are no factors that
begin exactly one character before their output.  Such factors correspond to
repetitions of that one character (e.g., "aaaa" = "a" x 4) and we can easily 
turn them into repetitions of a pair (e.g., "aa" x 2).

It's then simply a matter of not pairing when it would prevent the
next character from synchronising with its backreference.  For
example, in "abcab," we'd skip pairing "ca" so that "ab" could pair
like the first occurrence did.  We also don't force a pair when the
backreference only includes the first letter, but not the second.
Finally, we opportunistically match consecutive unpaired letters.

{% img center /images/2014-03-30-refactoring-with-lz77-compilation-is-compression/jez.jpg %}

Each such pass creates a new, shorter, string of literals and production rules. 
We iteratively apply the guided pairing loop until we're left with a single
production rule.

That's it.  Jez's paper is mostly concerned with showing that we only
have to run LZ compression once and with proving suboptimality bounds.
The key is that we can convert factors for the input into factors for
the output, and that each pass shrinks the string by a multiplicative
factor.  I'll simplify things further by recomputing a factorisation
(in cubic time!) from scratch in each pass.

Now, the code
=============

{% codeblock %}

             (assert (<= end (length *sequence*)))

               (incf begin))
             ;; Mimic the pairing decisions of the backref.
             (loop with expected = (+ *index* (- end begin))
                   for i from begin below end
                   do (ecase (aref *state* i)

                        ((nil) (single)))
                   finally (assert (= *index* expected))))))))
{% endcodeblock %}

My implementation is exceedingly naÃ¯ve and runs in cubic time in the
worst case.  With a lot more work, the bottleneck (LZ77 factorisation)
runs at the speed of sortâ€¦ but constructing a suffix array would only
get in the way of this post.  Let's just see what pairing the code
generates.

{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (with-sequence ("abcab")
           (loop while (< *index* (length *sequence*))
                 do (sync-and-pair)
                 finally (return *state*)))
#(FIRST SECOND NIL FIRST SECOND)
CL-USER> (with-sequence ("abababa")
           (loop while (< *index* (length *sequence*))
                 do (sync-and-pair)
                 finally (return *state*)))
#(FIRST SECOND FIRST SECOND FIRST SECOND NIL)
CL-USER> (with-sequence ("ababac||bac")
           (loop while (< *index* (length *sequence*))
                 do (sync-and-pair)
                 finally (return *state*)))
#(FIRST SECOND FIRST SECOND FIRST SECOND FIRST SECOND NIL FIRST SECOND)
{% endcodeblock %}

In short, "abcab" becomes "(ab)c(ab)", "abababa" "(ab)(ab)(ab)a",
and "ababac||bac" "(ab)(ab)(ac)(||)b(ac)".

Programs from pairs
===================

So far, we've only made pairing decisions.  The next step is to
translate them into production rules (i.e., functions), and to merge
equivalent rules to actually save space.

{% codeblock %}
(defvar *counter* 0)
(defvar *rules* (make-array 0 :adjustable t :fill-pointer 0))

(defstruct rule
  (id (incf *counter*))
  a b)

;; Hash-consing naturally merges equivalent rules.
(fare-memoization:define-memo-function rule (a b)
  (let ((rule (make-rule :a a :b b)))
    (vector-push-extend rule *rules*)
    rule))

(defun reset-rules ()
  (setf *counter* 0)
  ;; Sorry, this is ugly.
  (fare-memoization:unmemoize 'rule)
  (fare-memoization:memoize 'rule)
  (setf *rules* (make-array 0 :adjustable t :fill-pointer 0)))

(defun pair-cfg (sequence state)
  (loop with acc = '()
        for i upfrom 0
        for character across sequence
        for choice across state
        do (ecase choice
             (second)
             (first (push (rule character (aref sequence (1+ i)))
                          acc))
             ((nil) (push character acc)))
        finally (return (coerce (nreverse acc) 'simple-vector))))

(defun compress-1 (sequence)
 (with-sequence (sequence)
    (loop with length = (length sequence)
          while (< *index* length)
          do (sync-and-pair)
          finally (return (pair-cfg *sequence* *state*)))))
{% endcodeblock %}

On the examples above, we find:
{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (reset-rules)
#()
CL-USER> (compress-1 "abcab")
#(#S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b) #\c #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b))
CL-USER> (compress-1 "abababa")
#(#S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b) #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b)
  #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b) #\a)
CL-USER> (compress-1 "ababac||bac")
#(#S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b) #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b)
  #S(RULE :ID 2 :A #\a :B #\c) #S(RULE :ID 3 :A #\| :B #\|) #\b
  #S(RULE :ID 2 :A #\a :B #\c))
{% endcodeblock %}

We only have to pair production rules further until the sequence
consists of a single rule (or literal).

{% codeblock %}
(defun refactor (sequence)
  (if (<= (length sequence) 1)
      sequence
      (refactor (compress-1 sequence))))
{% endcodeblock %}

{% codeblock %}
CL-USER> (refactor "ababac||bac")
#(#S(RULE
     :ID 8
     :A #S(RULE
           :ID 7
           :A #S(RULE
                 :ID 4
                 :A #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b)
                 :B #S(RULE :ID 1 :A #\a :B #\b))
           :B #S(RULE
                 :ID 5
                 :A #S(RULE :ID 2 :A #\a :B #\c)
                 :B #S(RULE :ID 3 :A #\| :B #\|)))
     :B #S(RULE :ID 6 :A #\b :B #S(RULE :ID 2 :A #\a :B #\c))))
{% endcodeblock %}

The "call graph" below shows there's a lot of sharing for such a short string.

I started by writing about compiling program traces, but so far I've only been
working with strings of characters.  Let's pretend the following PostScript file

This second PostScript program comprises 211 tokens, rather than the
original's 156, but 105 of those are "{ } def" noise to define
functions.  Arguably, the number of meaningful tokens was reduced from
156 to slightly more than 100.  Crucially, the output remains the
same.

{% img center /images/2014-03-30-refactoring-with-lz77-compilation-is-compression/squares2.png %}

Stack programs seem particularly well suited to this rewriting
approach: explicit operands (e.g., registers) introduce trivial
discrepancies.  In a VM, I would consider "compressing" the opcode
stream separately from the operands.  Compiling only the former to
native code would already reduce interpretative overhead, and
extracting function calls from the instruction stream should avoid
catastrophic size explosions.

There are several obvious deficiencies in the direct LZ77-guided
pairing.  Just breaking Chomsky normalisation to inline single-use
function would already help.  It might also make sense to special-case
repetitions as `repeat n` loops, instead of hiding that in
\\(\log n\\) levels of recursion.  In a real program, it would also be
useful to inline the bottom-most rules so as not to drown in control
flow.  The thing is, destroying structure in the name of performance
is well understood compiler tech; recovering it *efficiently* was the
hard part.
