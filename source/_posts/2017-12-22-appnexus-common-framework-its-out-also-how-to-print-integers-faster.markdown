Back in 2014, [AppNexus](https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/careers)
needed a faster way to convert machine integers to strings.  It's a
stupid problem to have--just use a binary format--but it's
surprisingly common.  Maybe a project can only grow large enough for
serialisation speed to be an issue if it first disregards some trivial
concerns.  I can finally share our solution: after failing to nicely
package our internal support code for years, we recently got the OK to
open source the
[AppNexus Common Framework (ACF)](https://github.com/appnexus/acf)
under the Apache License 2.0, despite its incomplete state.

In the words of a friend and former colleague:

If you don't want to read more about what's in ACF and why I feel
it's important to open source imperfect repositories,
[jump to the section on fast `itoa`](#an_itoa).

ACF contains the base data structure and runtime library code we use
to build production services, in C that targets Linux/x86-64.  Some of it is
correctly packaged, most of it just has the raw files from our
internal repository.  Ironically, after settling on the project's
name, we decided not to publish the most "framework-y" bits of code:
it's unclear why anyone else would want to use it.  The data
structures are in C, and tend to be read-optimised, with perhaps some
support for non-blocking single-writer/multi-reader concurrency.
There's also non-blocking algorithms to support the data structures,
and basic HTTP server code that we find useful to run CPU-intensive or
mixed CPU/network-intensive services.

Publishing this internal code took a long time because we were trying
to open a project that didn't exist yet, despite being composed of
code that we use every day.  [AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com)
doesn't sell code or binaries.  Like many other companies, AppNexus
sells services backed by in-house code.  Our code base is full of
informal libraries (I would be unable to make sense of the code base
if it wasn't organised that way), but enforcing a clean separation
between pseudo-libraries can be a lot of extra work for questionable
value.

These fuzzy demarcations are made worse by the way we imported some
ideas directly from Operating Systems literature, in order to support
efficient concurrent operations.  That had a snowball effect:
everything, even basic data structures, ends up indirectly depending
on runtime system/framework code specialised for our use case.  The
usual initial offenders are the safe memory reclamation module, and
the tracking memory allocator (with a bump pointer mode); both go deep
in internals that probably don't make sense outside AppNexus.

Back in 2015, we looked at our support code (i.e., code that doesn't
directly run the business) and decided we should share it.  We
were--and still are--sure that other people face similar challenges,
and exchanging ideas, if not directly trading code, can only be good
for us and for programming in general.  We tried to untangle the
"Common" (great name) support library from the rest of the code base,
and to decouple it from the more opinionated parts of our code, while
keeping integration around (we need it), but purely opt-in.

That was hard. Aiming for a separate _shared object_ and a real Debian
package made it even harder than it had to be.  The strong separation
between packaged ACF code and the rest of repo added a lot of
friction, and the majority of the support code remained in-tree.

Maybe we made a mistake when we tried to librarify our internals.
We want a library of reusable code; that doesn't have to mean a
literal shared object.  I'm reminded of the two definitions of
portable code: code sprinkled with platform conditionals, or code that
can be made to run on a new machine with minimal effort.  Most of the
time, I'd rather have the latter.  Especially when code mostly runs on
a single platform, or is integrated in few programs, I try to reduce
overhead for the common case, while making reuse *possible* and easy
enough that others can benefit.

{% pullquote %}
And that's how we got the ACF effort out of the door: 
{" we accepted that the result would not be as polished as our favourite open source libraries, and that most of the code wouldn't even be packaged or disentangled from  internals. "} That's far
from an ideal state, but
it's closer to our goals than keeping the project private and on the
backburner.  We got it out by "feature" boxing the amount of
work--paring it down to figuring out what would never be useful to others,
and tracking down licenses and provenance--before pushing the partial
result out to a public repository.  Unsurprisingly, once that was
done, we completed more tasks on ACF in a few days than we have in the
past year.
{% endpullquote %}

Now that [ACF](https://github.com/appnexus/acf) is out, we still have
to figure out the best way to help others co-opt our code, to
synchronise the public repository with our internal repository, and,
in my dreams, to accept patches for the public repo and have them also
work for the internal one.  In the end, what's important is that the
code is out there with a clear license, and that someone with similar
problems can easily borrow our ideas, if not our code.

The source isn't always pretty, and is definitely not as well packaged and
easily re-usable as we'd like it to be, but it has proved itself in
production (years of use on thousands of cores), and builds to our
real needs.  The code also tries to expose correct and efficient
enough code in ways that make correct usage easy, and, ideally, misuse
hard.  Since we were addressing specific concrete challenges, we were
able to tweak contracts and interfaces a bit, even for standard
functionality like memory allocation.

The last two things are what I'm really looking for when exploring
other people's support code: how did usage and development experience
drive interface design, and what kind of non-standard tradeoffs
allowed them to find new low-hanging fruits?

If anyone else is in the same situation, please give yourself the
permission to open source something that's not yet fully packaged.  As
frustrating as that can be, it has to be better than keeping it
closed.  I'd rather see real, flawed but production-tested, code from
which I can take inspiration than nothing at all.

How to print integers faster
----------------------------

<a name="an_itoa" href="#an_itoa">Â¶</a> The 
[integer to string conversion file (`an_itoa`)](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/src/an_itoa.c)
is one instance of code that relaxes the usual `[u]itoa` contract
because it was written for a specific problem (which also gave us
real data to optimise for).  The relaxation stems from the fact that
callers should reserve up to 10 chars to convert 32 bit (unsigned)
integers, and 20 chars for 64 bit ones: we let the routines write
garbage (`0`/`NUL` bytes) after the converted string, as long as it's
in bounds.  This allowance, coupled with a smidge of thinking, let us
combine a few cute ideas to solve the depressingly common problem of
needing to print integers quickly.
[Switching to `an_itoa`](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/include/an_itoa.h)
might be a quick win for someone else, so I cleaned it up
and packaged it immediately after making the repository public.

We wrote `an_itoa` in July 2014.  Back then, we had an application
with a moderate deployment (a couple racks on three continents) that
was approaching capacity.  While more machines were in the pipeline, a
quick `perf` run showed it was spending a lot of time converting
strings to integers and back.  We already had a fast-ish string to
integer function.  Converting machine integers back to string however,
is a bit more work, and took up around 20% of total CPU time.

Of course, the real solution here is to not have this problem.  We
shouldn't have been using a human-readable format like JSON in the
first place.  We had realised the format would be a problem a long
time ago, and were actually in the middle of a transition to
[protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
after a first temporary fix (replacing a piece of
theoretically reconfigurable JavaScript that was almost never
reconfigured with hardcoded C that performed the same JSON
manipulation).  But, there we were, in the middle of this slow
transition involving terabytes of valuable persistent data, and we
needed another speed boost until protobuf was ready to go.

When you're stuck with C code that was manually converted, line by
line, from JavaScript, you don't want to try and make high level
changes to the code.  The only reasonable quick win was to make
the conversion from integer to string faster.

Human readable formats wasting CPU cycles to print integers is a
common problem, and we quickly found a few promising approaches and
libraries.  Our baseline was the radix-10 code in
[stringencoders](https://github.com/client9/stringencoders/blob/master/src/modp_numtoa.c#L52).
This [post about Lwan](https://tia.mat.br/posts/2014/06/23/integer_to_string_conversion.html)
suggested using radix-10, but generating strings backward instead of
reversing like the `stringencoders` library.  Facebook apparently hit
a similar problem in 2013, which lead to 
[this solution](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/three-optimization-tips-for-c/10151361643253920)
by Andrei Alexandrescu.  The Facebook code combines two key
ideas: radix-100 encoding, and finding the length of the string with
galloping search to write the result backward, directly where it
should go.

Radix-100 made sense, although I wasn't a fan of the 200-byte lookup
table.  I was also dubious of the galloping search; it's a lot of
branches, and not necessarily easy to predict.  The kind of `memmove`
we need to fixup after conversion is small and easy to specialise on
x86, so we might not need to predict the number of digits at all.

I then looked at the microbenchmarks for Andrei's code, and they made
it look like the code was either tested on integers with a fixed
number of digits (e.g., only 4-digit integers), or randomly picked
with uniform probability over a large range.

If the number of digits is fixed, the branchiness of galloping search
isn't an issue.  When sampling uniformlyâ¦ it's also not an issue
because most integers are large!  If I pick an integer at random in
`[0, 1e6)`, 90% of the integers have 6 digits, 99% 5 or 6, etc.

Sometimes, uniform selection is representative of the real workload
(e.g., random uids or sequential object ids).  Often, not so much.  In
general, small numbers are more common; for example, small counts can be
expected to roughly follow a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution).

I was also worried about data cache footprint with the larger lookup
table for radix-100 encoding, but then realised we were converting
integers in tight loops, so the lookup table should usually be hot.
That also meant we could afford a lot of instruction bytes; a multi-KB
`atoi` function wouldn't be acceptable, but a couple hundred bytes was
fine.

Given these known solutions, [John](https://twitter.com/johnwittrock/)
and I started doodling for a bit.  Clearly, the radix-100 encoding
was a good idea.  We now *had* to know if we could do better.

Our first attempt was to find the number of decimal digits more
quickly than with the galloping search.  It turns out that
approximating \\(\log\sb{10}\\) is hard, and we gave up ;)

We then realised we didn't need to know the number of decimal digits.
If we generated the string in registers, we could find the length
after the fact, slide bytes with bitwise shifts, and directly
write to memory.

I was still worried about the lookup table: the random accesses in the
200 byte table for radix-100 encoding could hurt when converting short
arrays of small integers.  I was more comfortable with some form of
arithmetic that would trade best-case speed for consistent, if slightly
sub-optimal, performance.  As it turns out, it's easy to convert values
between 0 and 100 to
[unpacked BCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal)
with a reciprocal multiplication by \\( 1/10 \\) and some in-register
bit twiddling.  Once we have a string of BCD bytes buffered in a
general purpose register, we can vertically add `'0'` to every byte in
the register to convert to ASCII characters.  We can even do the whole
conversion on a pair of such values at once, with SIMD within a
register.

The radix-100 approach is nice because it chops up the input two
digits at a time; the makespan for a given integer is roughly half as
long, since modern CPUs have plenty of execution units for the body.

The dependency graph for radix-10 encoding of `12345678` looks like
the following, with 7 serial steps.

{% img center /images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/radix-10.png %}

Going for radix-100 halves the number of steps, to 4.  The steps are
still serial, except for the conversion of integers in `[0, 100)` to
strings.

{% img center /images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/radix-100.png %}

Could we expose even more
[ILP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism)
than the radix-100 loop?

The trick is to divide and conquer: divide by 10000 (`1e4`) before
splitting each group of four digits with a radix-100 conversion.

{% img center /images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/dc.png %}

Recursive encoding gives us fewer steps, and 2 of the 3 steps can
execute in parallel.  However, that might not always be worth the
trouble for small integers, and we know that small numbers are common.
Even if we have a good divide-and-conquer approach for larger
integers, we must also implement a fast path for small integers.

The fast path for small integers (or the most significant limb of
larger integers) converts a 2- or 4- digit integer to unpacked BCD,
bitscans for the number of leading zeros, converts the BCD to ASCII by
adding `'0'` (`0x30`) to each byte, and shifts out any leading zero;
we assume that trailing noise is acceptable, and it's all `NUL` bytes
anyway.

For 32-bit integers
[`an_itoa`](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/src/an_itoa.c#L236) 
(really `an_uitoa`) looks like:

    if number < 100:
	    execute specialised 2-digit function
	if number < 10000:
	    execute specialised 4-digit function
	
	partition number with first 4 digits, next 4 digits, and remainder.
	
	convert first 2 groups of 4 digits to string.
	If the number is < 1e8:  # remainder is 0!
	    shift out leading zeros, print string.
	else:
	    print remainder # at most 100, since 2^32 < 1e10
		print strings for the first 2 groups of 4 digits.

The 64 bit version,
[`an_ltoa`](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/src/an_itoa.c#L342)
(really `an_ultoa`) is more of the same, with differences when the
input number exceeds `1e8`.

Is it actually faster?
----------------------

I've already concluded that cache footprint was mostly not an issue,
but we should still made sure we didn't get anything *too* big.

* `an_itoa`: 400 bytes.
* `an_ltoa`: 880 bytes
* `fb_itoa`: 426 bytes + 200 byte LUT
* `fb_constant_itoa` (without the galloping search): 172 bytes + 200 byte LUT
* `lwan_itoa` (radix-10, backward generation): 60 bytes.
* `modp_uitoa10`: 91 bytes.

The galloping search in Facebook's converter takes a lot of space
(there's a ton of conditional branches, and large numbers must be
encoded somewhere).  Even if we disregard the lookup table, `an_itoa`
is *smaller* than `fb_itoa`, and `an_ltoa` (which adds code for > 32
bit integers) is only 254 bytes larger than `fb_itoa` (+ LUT).  Now,
Facebook's galloping search attempts to make small integers go faster
by checking for them first; if we convert small numbers, we don't
expect to use all ~250 bytes in the galloping search.  However,
`an_itoa` and `an_ltoa` are similar: the code is setup such that
larger numbers jump forward over specialised subroutines for small
integers.  Small integers thus fall through to only execute code at
the beginning of the functions.  400 or 800 bytes are sizable
footprints compared to the 60 or 90 bytes of the radix-10 functions,
but acceptable when called in tight loops.

Now that we feel like the code and lookup table sizes are reasonable
(something that microbenchmarks rarely highlight), we can look at
speed.

I first ran the conversion with random integers in each digit count
class from 1 digit (i.e., numbers in `[0, 10)`) to 19 (numbers in
`[1e8, 1e9)`).  The instruction cache was hot, but the routines were
not warmed on that size class of numbers (more realistic that way).

The results are cycle counts (with the minimum overhead for a no-op
conversion subtracted from the raw count), on an unloaded 2.4 GHz Xeon
E5-2630L, a machine that's similar to our older production hardware.

We have data for:

* `an_itoa`, our 32 bit conversion routine;
* `an_ltoa`, our 64 bit conversion routine;
* `fb_constant_itoa`, Facebook's code, with the galloping search
  stubbed out;
* `fb_itoa`, Facebook's radix-100 code;
* `itoa`, GNU libc conversion (via sprintf);
* `lw_itoa`, [Lwan](https://lwan.ws/)'s backward radix-10 converter;
* `modp`, stringencoder's radix-10 / `strreverse` [converter](https://github.com/client9/stringencoders/blob/master/src/modp_numtoa.c#L52).

I included `fb_constant_itoa` to serve as a lower bound on the
radix-100 approach: the conversion loop stops as soon as it hits 0
(same as `fb_itoa`), but the data is written at a fixed offset, like
`lw_itoa` does.  In both `fb_constant_itoa`'s and `lw_itoa`'s cases,
we'd need another copy to slide the part of the output buffer that was
populated with characters over the unused padding (that's why
`fb_itoa` has a galloping search).

When I chose these functions back in 2014, they were all I could find
that was reasonable.  Since then, I've seen one other divide and
conquer implementation, although it uses a lookup table instead of
arithmetic to convert radix-100 limbs to characters, and an SSE2
implementation that only pays off for larger integers (32 bits or
more).

Some functions only go up to `UINT32_MAX`, in which case we have no
data after 9 digits.  The [raw data is here](/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/digits.tab.gz); I used
[this R script](/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/plot.R) to generate the plot.

<a href="/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/digits_large.png">
{% img center /images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/digits.png %}
</a>

The solid line is the average time per conversion (in cycles), over
10K data points, while the shaded region covers the 10th percentile to
the 90th percentile.

(GNU) libc's conversion is just wayy out there.  The straightforward
`modp` (stringencoders) code overlaps with Facebook's `itoa`; it's
slightly slower, but so much smaller.

We then have two incomplete string encoders: neither
`fb_constant_itoa` nor `lw_itoa` generates their output where it should
go.  They fill a buffer from the end, and something else (not
benchmarked) is responsible for copying the valid bytes where they
belong.  If an incomplete implementation suffices, Lwan's radix-10
approach is already competitive with, arguably faster than, the
Facebook code.  The same backward loop, but in radix-100, is
definitely faster than Facebook's full galloping search/radix-100
converter.

Finally, we have `an_itoa` and `an_ltoa`, that are neck and neck with
one another, faster than both `modp` and `fb_itoa` on small and large
integers, and even comparable with or faster than the incomplete
converters.  Their runtime is also more reliable (less variance) than
`modp`'s and `fb_itoa`'s: `modp` pays for the second variable length
loop in `strreverse`, and `fb_itoa` for the galloping search.  There
are more code paths in `an_itoa` and `an_ltoa`, but no loop, so the
number of (unpredictable) conditional branches is lower.

What have we learned from this experiment?

1. It's easy to improve on (g)libc's `sprintf`.  That makes sense,
   since that code is so generic.  However, in practice, we only
   convert to decimal, some hex, even less octal, and the rest is
   noise.  Maybe we can afford to special case these bases.
2. The double traverse in `modp_uitoa10` hurts.  It does make sense
   to avoid that by generating backward, ideally in the right spot
   from the start.
3. Radix-100 encoding is a win over radix-10 (`fb_constant_itoa` is
   faster than `lwan_itoa`).
4. Using registers as buffers while generating digits is a win
   (`an_itoa` and `an_ltoa` are faster for small values).
5. Divide and conquer is also a win (`an_ltoa` is flatter for large
   integers).

With results that made sense for an easily understood microbenchmark,
I decided to try a bunch of distributions.  Again, the code was hot,
the predictors lukewarm, and we gathered 10K cycle counts per
distribution/function.  The [raw data is here](/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/nondigits.tab.gz),
and I used
[this R script](/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/plot.R) to generate the plot.

The independent variables are all categorical here, so I use one facet
per distribution, and, in each facet, a boxplot per conversion
function, as well as a jittered scatter plot to show the distribution
of cycle counts.

<a href="/images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/nondigits_large.png">
{% img center /images/2017-12-22-appnexus-common-framework-its-out-also-how-to-print-integers-faster/nondigits.png %}
</a>

Clearly, we can disregard glibc's `sprintf` (`itoa`).

The first facet generated integers by choosing uniformly between
\\(100, 1000, 10\sp{4}, \ldots, 10\sp{8}\\).  That's a semi-realistic
variation on the earlier dataset, which generated a bunch of numbers in
each size class, and serves as an easily understood worst-case for
branch prediction.  Both `an_itoa` and `an_ltoa` are faster than the
other implementations, and branchier implementations (`fb_itoa` and
`modp`) show their variance.  Facebook's `fb_itoa` isn't even faster
than `modp`'s radix-10/`strreverse` encoder.  The galloping search
really hurts: `fb_constant_itoa`, without that component, is slightly
faster than the radix-10 `lw_itoa`.

The second facet is an even harder case for branch predictors: random
values skewed with an exponential (`pow(2, 64.0 * random() / RAND_MAX)`),
to simulate real-world counts.  Both `an_itoa` and
`an_ltoa` are faster than the other implementations, although
`an_ltoa` less so: `an_itoa` only handles 32 bit integers, so it deals
with less entropy.  Between the 32-bit implementations, `an_itoa` is
markedly faster and more consistent than `lw_itoa` (which is
incomplete) and `modp`.  Full 64-bit converters generally exhibit more
variance in runtime (their input is more randomised), but `an_ltoa` is
still visibly faster than `fb_itoa`, and even than the incomplete
`fb_constant_itoa`.  We also notice that `fb_itoa`'s runtimes are more
spread out than `fb_constant_itoa`: the galloping search adds overhead
in time, but also a lot of variance.  That makes me think that the
Facebook code is more sensitive than others to difference in data
distribution between microbenchmarks and production.

The third facet should be representative of printing internal
sequential object ids: uniform integers in `[0, 256K)`.  As expected,
every approach is tighter than with the skewed "counts" distribution
(most integers are large).  The `an_itoa`/`an_ltoa` options are faster
than the rest, and it's far from clear that `fb_itoa` is preferable to
even `modp`.  The range was also chosen because it's somewhat of a
worst case for `an_itoa`: the code does extra work for values between
\\(10\sp{4}\\) and \\(10\sp{8}\\) to have more to do before the
conditional branch for `x < 1e8`.  That *never* pays off in the range
tested here.  However, even with this weakness, `an_itoa` still seems
preferable to `fb_itoa`, and even to the simpler `modp_uitoa10`.

The fourth facet (first of the second row) shows what happens when we
choose random integers in `[0, 20)`.  That test case is interesting
because it's small, thus semi-representative of some of our counts,
and because it needs 1 or 2 digits with equal probability.  Everything
does pretty well, and runtime distributions are overall tight; branch
predictors can do a decent job when there are only two options.  I'm
not sure why there's such a difference between `an_itoa` and
`an_ltoa`'s distribution.  Although the code for any value less than
100 is identical at the C level, there are small difference in code
generationâ¦ but I can't pinpoint where the difference might come from.

The fifth facet, for random integers in `[100, 200)` is similar, with
a bit more variance.

The sixth facet generates unix timestamps around a date in 2014 with
uniform selection plus or minus one million second.  It's meant to be
representative of printing timestamps.  Again, `an_itoa` and `an_ltoa`
are faster than the rest, with `an_itoa` being slightly faster and
more consistent.  Radix-100 (`fb_constant_itoa`) is faster and more
consistent than radix-10 (`lw_itoa`), but it's not clear if `fb_itoa`
is preferable to `modp`.  The variance for `modp` is larger than for
the other implementations, even `fb_itoa`: that's the cost of a
radix-10 loop and of the additional `strreverse`.

This set of results shows that conditional branches are an issue when
converting integers to strings, and that the impact of branches
strongly depends on the distribution.  The Facebook approach, with a
galloping search for the number of digits, seems particularly
sensitive to the distribution.  Running something like `fb_itoa`
because it does well in microbenchmark is thus only a good idea if we
know that the microbenchmark is representative of production.

Bigger numbers take more time to convert, but the divide and conquer
approach of `an_itoa` and `an_ltoa` is consistently faster at the high
end, while their unrolled SIMD-within-a-register fast path does well for
small numbers.

So, if you ever find yourself bottlenecked on `s[n]printf`
----------------------------------------------------------

{% pullquote %}
The correct solution to the "integer printing is too slow" problem is simple:
don't do that.  After all, {" remember the first rule of high performance string processing: "DON'T." "}
When there's no special requirement, I find [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) does very well as
a better JSON.
{% endpullquote %}

However, once you find yourself in this bad spot, it's trivial to do
better than generic libc conversion code.  This makes it a dangerously
fun problem in a wayâ¦ especially given that the data distribution can
matter so much.  No benchmark is perfect, but various implementations
are affected differently by flaws in microbenchmarks.  It's thus
essential not to overfit on the benchmark data, probably even more
important than improving performance by another factor of 10% or 20%
(doing 4-5x better than libc code is already a given).  That's why I
prefer integer conversion code with more consistent cycle counts:
there's less room for differences due to the distribution of data.

Finally, if, like 2014-AppNexus, you find yourself converting a lot of
integers to strings in tight loops (on x86-64 machines), 
[try `an_itoa` or `an_ltoa`](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/src/an_itoa.c)!
The [whole repository is Apache 2.0](https://github.com/appnexus/acf),
and it should be easy to copy and paste all the dependencies to pare
it down to two files.  If you do snatch our code, note that the
functions use their destination array (up to 10 bytes for `an_itoa`,
and `20` for `an_ltoa`) as scratch space, even for small integers.
