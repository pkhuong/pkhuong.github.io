        <h3>Hacking SSE Intrinsics in SBCL (part 1)</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>I think I managed to add sane support for SSE values (octwords) and
operations to SBCL this weekend (all that because of a discussion on
PRNGs which lead to remembering that <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/">SFMT</a> wasn't too hard to
implement, which lead to SSE intrinsics). It wasn't too hard, but
clearly the path could have been better documented. The interesting
part is the creation of a new primitive data type in the compiler;
once that is done, we only have to define new VOPs. Note that since
I'm only targetting x86-64, alignment isn't an issue: objects are
aligned to 128 bit by default.</p>

<p>The compiler has to be informed of the new data type at two levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>The front/middle -end, to create a new type (as in <code>CL:TYPEP</code>), and to
define how to map from that type to the primitive type (which is
more concerned about representation than semantics) used in
the back-end;</li>

<li>The back-end, which has to be informed about the existence of a new
primitive type, and must also be modified to correctly map that
primitive type to machine registers or stack locations, and to know
how to move from one to the other or how to box such values in a
GC-friendly object on the heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously the runtime was also be modified to be able to GC the new
type of objects.</p>

<p>I believe it makes more sense to do this by starting low-level, in the
back-end, and then building things up to the front-end, so I'll try
and explain it that way.</p>

<h2>Hacking the machine definition</h2>

<p class="first">SBCL's backend has a sort of type system at the <code>VOP</code> / <code>TN</code> level
(virtual operations/registers). Two elements of type information are
associated with each <code>TN</code>: the primitive type and the storage class. As
its name implies, the primitive type is a low-level, C-style type
(e.g. <code>SIMPLE-ARRAY-UNSIGNED-BYTE-64</code> or <code>DOUBLE-FLOAT</code>), which is almost
entirely concerned with representation. Apart from bad puns, there is
no subtyping; <code>COMPLEX</code> and <code>COMPLEX-DOUBLE-FLOAT</code> are disjoint
types. However, that still leaves some leeway to the back-end. A
<code>DOUBLE-FLOAT</code> may be stored in a FP register, on the stack, or as a
boxed value. Thus, <code>TN</code> are also assigned a storage class before
generating code.</p>

<p>The first step was to define new storage classes for SSE values:
<code>sse-reg</code> and <code>sse-stack</code> for SSE values in <code>XMM</code> registers and on the
stack, respectively. That's done in <code>src/compiler/x86-64/vm.lisp</code>,
<code>!define-storage-classes</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
  (sse-stack stack :element-size 2 :alignment 2)

[...]

  (sse-reg float-registers
           :locations #.(loop for i from 0 below 15 collect i)
           :constant-scs ()
           :save-p t
           :alternate-scs (sse-stack))
</pre>

<p>The first form defines a new storage class (<code>SC</code>) that's stored on the
stack (the storage <em>base</em>, <code>SB</code>), where each element takes two locations
(in this case, 64 bit words) and requires an alignment of two
locations. The second form defines a new storage class that uses the
<code>float-registers</code> storage base, and may take any of the first 15
locations in that <code>SB</code> (<code>xmm15</code> is reserved). Values in that <code>SC</code> must be
saved to the stack when needed. The <code>sse-stack</code> <code>SC</code> is to be used when
there aren't enough registers or when saving registers (e.g. for a
call). Some more modifications were needed in the assembler to make it
aware of the new <code>SC</code>, but that's a mostly orthogonal concern.</p>


<h2>Adding a new primitive type</h2>

<p class="first">That's enough to define a new primitive type in
<code>src/compiler/generic/primtype.lisp</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
(!def-primitive-type sse-value (sse-reg descriptor-reg))
</pre>

<p><code>sse-value</code> can be stored in <code>sse-reg</code> or <code>descriptor-reg</code> (as boxed
values), or in any of their alternate <code>SC</code>.</p>


<h2>Defining a new kind of primitive object</h2>

<p class="first">I've defined a new primitive type that can be stored as a boxed
value. However, I haven't yet defined how that boxed value should be
represented. I allocated one of the unused widetags to
<code>sse-values</code> in <code>src/compiler/generic/early-objdef.lisp</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
  #!-x86-64
  unused02
  #!+x86-64
  sse-value                         ; 01100010
</pre>

<p>That's not necessary, but I would then have to define my own
typechecking <code>VOPs</code>, adapt the GC somehow, etc. It will define a new
constant, <code>SB!VM::SSE-VALUE-WIDETAG</code>. I use it in the primitive object
definition (<code>src/compiler/generic/objdef.lisp</code>):</p>

<pre class="example">
(define-primitive-object (sse-value
                          :lowtag other-pointer-lowtag
                          :widetag sse-value-widetag)
  (filler) ; preserve the natural 128 bit alignment
  (lo-value :c-type &quot;long&quot; :type (unsigned-byte 64))
  (hi-value :c-type &quot;long&quot; :type (unsigned-byte 64)))
</pre>

<p>The macro will also define useful constants, e.g. <code>SSE-VALUE-SIZE</code>, as
well as slot offsets for the low and high values. That information
will be needed by the GC. Genesis only exports CL constants to C when
the symbols are external to the package. Thus, I had to add some
symbols to the export list for <code>SB!VM</code> in <code>./package-data-list.lisp-expr</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE&quot;
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE-P&quot; ; will be defined later on
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE-HI-VALUE-SLOT&quot;
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE-LO-VALUE-SLOT&quot;
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE-SIZE&quot;
               #!+x86-64 &quot;SSE-VALUE-WIDETAG&quot;
</pre>

<p>and similarly for <code>SB!KERNEL</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
               #!+x86-64
               &quot;OBJECT-NOT-SSE-VALUE-ERROR&quot; ; so will this
</pre>


<h2>Adapting the GC</h2>

<p class="first">I chose a very simple representation for <code>sse-values</code>: the header word
will contain the right widetag, obviously, and the rest will encode
the size of the object (in words). That's a common scheme in SBCL, and
well supported by generic code everywhere. The garbage collector (a
copying Cheney GC) has three important tables that are used to
dispatch to the correct function given an object's widetag: <code>scavtab</code> to
scavenge objects for pointers, <code>transother</code> to copy objects to the new
space and <code>sizetab</code> to compute the size of an object. They're all
initialised in <code>src/runtime/gc-common.c</code>, <code>gc_init_tables</code>. The
representation is standard, so I only had to add pointers to
predefined functions, <code>scav_unboxed</code>, <code>trans_unboxed</code> and <code>size_unboxed</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
#ifdef SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG
    scavtab[SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG] = scav_unboxed;
#endif

[...]

#ifdef SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG
    transother[SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG] = trans_unboxed;
#endif

[...]

#ifdef SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG
    sizetab[SSE_VALUE_WIDETAG] = size_unboxed;
#endif
</pre>


<h2>Adding utility VOPs to the compiler</h2>

<p class="first">That's enough code to be able to use the <code>sse-value</code> primitive type, use
our new storage classes in <code>VOP</code> definitions, and pass boxed <code>sse-values</code>
around without crashing the GC. The first <code>VOPs</code> to define are probably
those that let the compiler move <code>sse-values</code> around, from an <code>sse-reg</code>,
<code>sse-stack</code> or <code>descriptor-reg</code> to another. Not all <code>VOPs</code> in the cartesian
product must be defined; the compiler can figure out how to piece
together move <code>VOPs</code> to a certain extent.</p>

<pre class="example">
(define-move-fun (load-sse-value 2) (vop x y)
  ((sse-stack) (sse-reg))
  (inst movdqa y (ea-for-sse-stack x)))

(define-move-fun (store-sse-value 2) (vop x y)
  ((sse-reg) (sse-stack))
  (inst movdqa (ea-for-sse-stack y) x))
</pre>

<p>are enough to define how to move between the stack and <code>xmm</code> registers
(<code>ea-for-sse-stack</code> is a helper function that generates an effective
address from an <code>sse-value</code> 's location in the compile-time stack
frame).</p>

<pre class="example">
(define-vop (sse-move)
  (:args (x :scs (sse-reg)
            :target y
            :load-if (not (location= x y))))
  (:results (y :scs (sse-reg)
               :load-if (not (location= x y))))
  (:note &quot;sse move&quot;)
  (:generator 0
    (unless (location= y x)
      (inst movdqa y x))))
(define-move-vop sse-move :move (sse-reg) (sse-reg))
</pre>

<p>provides and registers code to move from one <code>xmm</code> register to another.</p>

<pre class="example">
(define-vop (move-from-sse)
  (:args (x :scs (sse-reg)))
  (:results (y :scs (descriptor-reg)))
  (:node-var node)
  (:note &quot;sse to pointer coercion&quot;)
  (:generator 13
     (with-fixed-allocation (y
                             sse-value-widetag
                             sse-value-size
                             node)
       (inst movdqa (make-ea :qword
                             :base y
                             :disp 1)
             x))))
(define-move-vop move-from-sse :move
  (sse-reg) (descriptor-reg))

(define-vop (move-to-sse)
  (:args (x :scs (descriptor-reg)))
  (:results (y :scs (sse-reg)))
  (:note &quot;pointer to sse coercion&quot;)
  (:generator 2
    (inst movdqa y (make-ea :qword :base x :disp 1))))
(define-move-vop move-to-sse :move (descriptor-reg) (sse-reg))
</pre>

<p>will be used to move from an <code>xmm</code> register to a boxed representation
and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

<pre class="example">
(define-vop (move-sse-arg)
  (:args (x :scs (sse-reg) :target y)
         (fp :scs (any-reg)
             :load-if (not (sc-is y sse-reg))))
  (:results (y))
  (:note &quot;SSE argument move&quot;)
  (:generator 4
     (sc-case y
       (sse-reg
        (unless (location= x y)
          (inst movdqa y x)))
       (sse-stack
        (inst movdqa (ea-for-sse-stack y fp) x)))))
(define-move-vop move-sse-arg :move-arg
  (sse-reg descriptor-reg) (sse-reg))
</pre>

<p>defines how arguments are loaded before calling a function.</p>


<h2>Creating a new CL type and associated functions</h2>

<p class="first">Now that pretty much all the groundwork has been done in the backend,
it's time to inform the frontend about the new data type. The system's
built-in classes are defined in <code>src/code/class.lisp</code>, right after
<code>(defvar *built-in-classes*)</code>. I only had to insert another sublist in
the list of built-in classes.</p>

<pre class="example">
     (sb!vm:sse-value
      :codes (#.sb!vm:sse-value-widetag))
</pre>

<p>That takes care of defining a new class for the middle-end, and of
mapping the class's name, in the front-end, to the class object in the
middle-end.</p>

<p>SBCL tries pretty hard to always provide a safe language by default,
so I have to make sure the type <code>sse-value</code> can be checked. First, a
new error kind is defined in <code>src/code/interr.lisp</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
(deferr object-not-sse-value-error (object)
  (error 'type-error
         :datum object
         :expected-type 'sb!vm:sse-value))
</pre>

<p>The mapping from internal error number to a meaningful message is
specified in <code>src/compiler/generic/interr.lisp</code>, <code>define-internal-errors:</code>
<code>(object-not-sse-value &quot;Object is not of type SSE-VALUE.&quot;)</code>.
Since I use a normal representation, I can use preexisting machinery
to define the type checking <code>VOPs</code> in <code>src/compiler/generic/late-type-vops.lisp</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
(!define-type-vops sse-value-p check-sse-value sse-value
    object-not-sse-value-error
  (sse-value-widetag))
</pre>

<p>That only creates a <code>VOP</code> for <code>sse-value-p</code>; we'd sometimes like to have a
real function. That's created in <code>src/code/pred.lisp</code>, with
<code>(def-type-predicate-wrapper sb!vm:sse-value-p)</code>. Moreover, when a <code>VOP</code>
is defined as a translation for a function, that function must be
<code>defknown</code> ed to the compiler. I do that in
<code>src/compiler/generic/vm-fndb.lisp</code>, with
<code>(defknown sb!vm:sse-value-p (t) boolean (foldable flushable))</code>.</p>

<p><code>TYPEP</code> must also be informed to use that function. That's set up in
<code>src/compiler/generic/vm-typetran.lisp</code>, with
<code>(define-type-predicate sb!vm:sse-value-p sb!vm:sse-value)</code>.</p>


<h2>Making the middle and the back meet</h2>

<p class="first">The modifications above added a new primitive type to the back-end,
along with some machinery to represent and manipulate values of
that type. They also added a new built-in class to the front and
middle -end and some type-checking code for that new class. The only
thing left is to make sure the new class is mapped to the correct
primitive type. The default is to map everything to the <em>primitive type</em>
<code>T</code>, a boxed value. That's done at the bottom of
<code>src/compiler/generic/primtype.lisp</code>, in <code>primitive-type-aux</code>. I only had
to modify the case of translating built-in class(oids) to primitive
types: <code>sse-value</code> are treated like <code>complex</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>system-area-pointer</code> or
<code>weak-pointer.</code> The class <code>sse-value</code> is mapped to the primitive type
<code>sse-value</code>. That way, a function that is <code>defknown</code> to, e.g., take an
argument of type <code>sse-value</code> (the class) can be translated by a <code>VOP</code> that
takes an argument of primitive type <code>sse-value</code>, which can be stored in
an <code>sse-reg</code> (an <code>xmm</code> register).</p>


<h2>Now what?</h2>

<p class="first">We have the data type definitions. To make them useful we still have
to define a lot of functions and <code>VOPs</code> (and <code>SSE</code> instructions). However,
that's much closer to regular development and doesn't require as much
digging around in the source. I'll leave that for another post.</p>
