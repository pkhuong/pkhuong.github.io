<p>I already wrote a relatively long document on the topic (available at
<a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/string-case.lisp">http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/string-case.lisp</a>), but the
format (pdf or source file) might not be ideal for everyone. I think
writing pattern matchers is a surprisingly frequent task, so I'll go
over the main points again here.</p>

<p>The usual approach used to implement <code>string-case</code> is to intern the
strings in a hash table (e.g. via symbols), and then use a normal
<code>eql</code> case. This seems lossy for at least two reasons: a hash lookup
must traverse the string at least twice (once to compute the hash
value, and some more to find the right key) and the <code>eql</code> case (usually)
adds a pass over all the cases. A specialised pattern matcher can do
much less work: each test's branches eliminate at least 1 candidate,
and once a single candidate is left, a single pass over the parts of
the input string that haven't been examined is needed. A string-case
based on perfect hashing would also be an option. However, finding
such a hash function can take some time, and pessimises behaviour on
mismatches.</p>

<p>Obviously, a pattern matcher should, at each step, split the candidate
patterns as close to 50/50 as possible, with only half of the
candidates left in the 'true' branch, and the other half in the
'false' branch. This can be a problem when some candidates are
applicable in both branches (code explosion or backtracking, more
complex metric, ...). Fortunately, this is not the case here, since we
only have constant values as patterns. In this case, first
discriminating on the length of the input seems like a good idea; it
may not give an even distribution between all the candidates, but it
simplifies the rest of the code (no need for bounds checking). For the
rest of the matching process, the function <code>find-best-split</code> simply
iterates over all the possible tests to find the one that leads to the
most even split. Note that an interesting property of strings is that
random access takes constant time, so, faced with similar cases
(e.g. &quot;foobaR&quot; and &quot;foobaZ&quot;), it is obviously a good idea to
discriminate on indices that actually differ (the last one here),
instead of fixing an arbitrary order ahead of time.</p>

<p>Once a single candidate is left, a last series of tests is still
needed to make sure the candidate does match the input. It would be
simple to simply keep track of the indices that haven't been used to
discriminate yet and emit the corresponding checks. This would however
lead to some code duplication for similar patterns, since most of the
indices (those for which the patterns are identical) would not have
been tested. It is only slightly more complex to emit the tests as
soon as all the candidates are identical on some indices, which will
lead to much less repetition.</p>

<p>While it's not very apparent in this case (since the patterns are
simply constant values), there's a certain tension between not doing
work twice (by fully specialising code) and controlling code size (by
executing common code as early as possible or by not fully
specialising code, thus making it common). On modern computers,
there's also the issue of branch prediction. Completely balanced
pattern matching code is practically the worst case possible: most
branches are taken exactly 50% of the time (there is no 'right' way to
predict them).</p>

<p>One way to alleviate this problem is to coalesce tests together and
only branch at the very end. This reduces the number of branches, and
thus the number of mispredictions. However, it also pessimises the
amount of computation needed, since there is no branch to abort
early. Again, there is a balance to be found to reduce the number of
branches without overly increasing the amount of work. In the
<code>string-case</code> macro, it is achieved by coalescing equality tests by
chunks of up to 4 indices (via <code>or</code> of multiple <code>xor</code> before branching).</p>

<p>Another way to attack the problem is to use the probability of each
case (if they're not uniform) to produce an unbalanced search tree
that gives a better <em>expected</em> runtime than a balanced one. This can be
pretty complex to achieve, though.</p>

<p>Pattern matchers are like the code-generation equivalent of
dictionaries (as in map, hash table, etc). Dictionaries are obviously
extremely important data structures in programming; I feel that the
usefulness of pattern matchers is often underestimated, especially by
users of languages that don't offer such functionalities built-in
(they instead end up writing simplistic code by hand). Another point
that is easily overlooked, even by people who already use pattern
matching, is that, just like there are many ways to implement
dictionaries (e.g. trie VS hash table), each with their strengths and
weaknesses, it is possible to implement pattern matching to take
advantage of properties of the problem (a typical pattern matcher for
algebraic data types would not use random access to variable-length
inputs). This might be why I end up writing special-purpose pattern
matchers much more often than most other programmers, and (yet) still
haven't found a way to write a satisfying generic pattern matcher.</p>

<p>Pattern matching is your friend, use it!</p>

<p>P.S. Here are some URLs that might be useful to someone who want to
implement a pattern matcher:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/xt-pattern.lisp">http://discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/xt-pattern.lisp</a> is my extensible
pattern matcher. It's 'generic', so probably decent for many
things, but wouldn't easily allow us to express the strategy
used in <code>string-case</code>. Still useful if you don't feel like writing your
own from scratch, or would like some inspiration for the general
architecture.</li>
<li><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/lefessant01optimizing.html">F. Le Fessant and L. Maranget. Optimizing Pattern Matching. In International Conference on Functional Programming. ACM press, 2001.</a>
is a paper describing the authors' experience while improving OCaml's pattern
matching, which is based in backtracking (which tightly controls
output code size but may do redundant work).</li>
<li><a href="http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/dagstuhl-pe96/14.pdf">P. Sestoft. ML Pattern Match Compilation and Partial Evaluation. In Dagstuhl Seminar on Partial Evaluation. Springer-Verlag, 1996. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1110.</a>
describes a pattern matcher for ML ADTs (again), but this time from a
program specialisation perspective. By fully specialising the pattern
matching code on known data, redundant work is completely eliminated,
but code size is not controlled anymore. Note that avoiding redundant
work is far from enough to ensure 'optimal' code: as evidenced by
<code>string-case</code>, deciding what to test for in what order (even with ADTs,
there is random access to members and temporaries) is crucial. In
fact, it would not be surprising to see a backtracking-based pattern
matcher outperform a fully specialising one, simply by choosing the
order in which to perform tests better.</li>
