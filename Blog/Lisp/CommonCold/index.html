        <h3>Hacking serialisable closures with SBCL</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>The key element in <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold/">Common Cold</a> was being able to generate
serialisable closures without having to transform all the lexically
enclosing code. To do that, I had to have access to two things:
all the functions in the lexical environment &mdash; remember that CL is a
Lisp-2, so even if <code>lambda</code> are serialisable, local functions won't
benefit from that automatically (that would also be pretty bad for
performance) &mdash; and all the variables in the enviroment (along with
their values, at runtime).</p>

<p>As would be expected, there is a list of all the lexical variable
definitions (whether they're symbol-macros, lexical variables or
dynamically scoped ones) in the lexical environment (lexenv)
object. After all, most of that is needed for <code>macroexpand</code> to work
correctly. As is logical, the innermost variables are at the
head. Even better: SBCL's compiler seems to always store the
information needed to inline local functions (in the lexenv), which
is, luckily enough, more than enough to recover their source and their
ordering. Some of that information is a bit hidden, however, since the
goals of the compiler are different from ours. What is directly
available in the lexenv object is a list of function 'nodes', with the
most nested function(s) first. Note how there is no direct way to know
how functions and variables are interleaved, or which functions were
defined in the same <code>labels</code> or <code>flet</code> (this is not an issue for
variables, since their value will already have been computed when
we'll unserialise the closures).</p>

<p>To recover that information, we can use the lexenv object associated
with each function node. To group functions together, we simply have
to detect when they close over the same set of functions.  Recursive
functions (defined with <code>labels</code>) also close over themselves, while
those defined with <code>flet</code> don't. Local macros are represented as
closures, so there is no need to get their grouping right, only the
ordering, which is implicit in the list of functions. Note that, since
local functions must be defined where they are bound (CL is a Lisp-2),
we know that simply getting this ordering and grouping right will be
enough to rebuild the correct lexical environment.</p>

<p>In order to know where each variable should be defined, we can, again,
use the lexenv object associated with each function node to find the
outermost (group of) function that closes over that variable. Now,
we can easily generate a form that will have all the function/macros
definition and variable binding/symbol macro definition forms nested
in the right order to recreate the lexical environment. To bind the
variables to the right values, the simplest way is to wrap the form
in a lambda, and take the values as arguments (bound to gensymmed
variables, otherwise there would be issues with variables that
have the same names). There is also the issue of local macros: macro
functions are stored as functions. Trying to store them in the form
would be quite painful: no dumping to fasls, no easy way to share the
data across processes, ... Instead, they are left in the form only to
expand all the macros away with sb-walker, and then removed from the
form. We can finally splice in whatever form we want inside all those
definitions and bindings (before macroexpanding everything). Once we
evaluate the complete form and pass it the values of the lexical
variables, we will have the value of the spliced in form, evaluated
inside a recreation of the lexical environment represented by the
lexenv object.</p>

<p>That still leaves the question of how to get the values of the
variables. Naively, since we have access to all the variables' names, it
seems like we could just generate a form to create a list of all the
variables' values. That dies when lexical scope is used to have two
variables with the same name. We also cannot only capture the value of
innermost variable of each name: the values are needed for surrounding
local functions. The solution that I found is to make sure I get a
fresh lexenv, side effect it to associate all the variable objects
with fresh names, and create the list inside that new environment.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold/closures.lisp">slightly more than 400 LOC</a>, this gives us a generic way to evaluate
forms in serialisable lexical environments, and thus serialisable
closures, and a global registry to unserialise these closures (and to
detect nearly duplicate unserialisers, which may happen with nested
serialisable closures, or serialisable closures inside local functions
that surround another serialisable closure, although that blow-up is,
at most, quadratic in the number of environment serialising forms).</p>

        <h3>Common Cold's special forms</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>The central element in serialising continuations are serialisable
closures. They are created by the macros <code>slambda</code> (serialisable lambda)
and <code>sfunction</code> (serialisable function), which can be used exactly like
the <code>lambda</code> and <code>function</code> special forms, except that <code>slambda</code> may not be
the <code>car</code> of an expression (or inside a <code>function</code> form), and that
<code>sfunction</code> can only be given a function's name as argument. These macros
will globally register the information needed to serialise and
deserialise the closures at compile-time, in a serialisable format.</p>

<p>For example, a serialisable adder could be created this way</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun make-adder (inc)
  (flet ((adder (x)
           (+ x inc)))
    (sfunction adder)))
</pre>
or that way

<pre class="example">
(defun make-adder (inc)
  (slambda (x)
    (+ x inc)))
</pre>

<p>Note that there is no need to annotate local variables or
functions. Highly unportable environment access is used to regenerate
information about the lexical scope surrounding an <code>slambda</code> or <code>sfunction</code>
form. Unfortunately, it means that it may also interact badly with
codewalked extensions.</p>

<p>Something close to Administrative-Normal Form (ANF, or monadic style)
is then used to expose enough structure to macros for them to be able
to easily save continuations. <code>(bind (var val) expr)</code> binds the
value of <code>val</code> to <code>var</code> in <code>expr</code>, adding <code>expr</code> to <code>val</code>'s
continuation. <code>dbind</code> is the same thing, but binds to <em>special</em>
(dynamically scoped) variables instead of lexical ones. This is enough
to make explicit the order in which operations will be executed, which
is exactly what is needed to implement continuations. There is no need
for a monadic <code>return</code>: we use dynamically scoped constructs (<code>catch</code> and
<code>throw</code>), so values need not be wrapped specially.</p>

<p>ANF is much less painful to use than CPS, but it's still far from
ideal. Common Cold offers several macros to emulate common CL values
binding forms. Instead of <code>let*</code>, one should use <code>mlet*</code> (to bind to
lexical variables) or <code>mdlet*</code> (to bind to special variables). For
example:</p>

<pre class="example">
(mlet* ((x (get-x))
        (y (get-y))
        (dist (sqrt (+ (* x x)
                       (* y y)))))
  (fn dist))
</pre>
or, if we want <code>fn</code> to have access to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as special variables:

<pre class="example">
(mdlet* ((*x* (get-x))
         (*y* (get-y)))
  (fn (sqrt (+ (* *x* *x*)
               (* *y* *y*)))))
</pre>

<p>Note that normal CL lexical binding forms (e.g., <code>let</code> or <code>let*</code>) may be
freely mixed with CC's forms, as long as the execution of the value
expressions (<code>(get-x)</code>, <code>(get-y)</code>, ... here) does not capture
continuations. CL <em>dynamic</em> binding forms (e.g. with <code>(declare (special...))</code>),
however, should only be used when the execution of both the value
expressions and the body of the forms (the dynamic extent of the
bindings) does not capture continuations. <code>mlet</code> (for lexical bindings)
and <code>mdlet</code> (for dynamic ones) offer a behaviour like that of CL's <code>let</code>,
where the bindings are only established once all the bound values have
been computed.</p>

<p>Creating serialisable closures and continuations establishes copies of
the lexical bindings. Assignment to lexical variables is thus not
recommended, at least not when <code>slambda</code> or <code>sfunction</code> forms are in the
lexical scope, or continuation-capturing code in the dynamic
scope. Dynamic bindings, on the other hand, are linked to the dynamic
environment, and not to continuation frames or closures. Thus, it makes
sense to capture them with the rest of the dynamic environment &mdash; at
least, as much of it &mdash; in continuations. Capturing continuations will
also save (copy) the values of all the bindings at the time of the
capture, so assignment to special variables is meaningful... without
continuations making it harder to reason about them.</p>

<p>Common Lisp's non-local exit forms (e.g., <code>throw</code> or <code>tagbody</code>) all have a
dynamic extent, which means they are useless after the capture and
later invocation of a continuation. Common Cold duplicates some of
these forms in order to be able to restore them when invoking
continuations. <code>mcatch</code> may be used exactly like <code>catch</code>, returning to it
with a normal <code>throw</code>. <code>mblock</code> (which, like <code>block</code>, establishes a lexical
non-local exit environment), on the other hand, must be matched with
<code>mreturn-from</code> or <code>mreturn</code> (which act like <code>return-from</code> and
<code>return</code>). Returning to a CL <code>block</code> with <code>mreturn-from</code>, or to an <code>mblock</code>
with <code>return-from</code> will result in erroneous code. Fortunately, they are
lexically scoped constructs, so using them correctly should be easy
(checkable locally).</p>

<p>Finally, to execute several operations in sequence, one should use
<code>mprogn</code>, which acts like <code>progn</code>. However, most of the special forms
above have implicit <code>mprogn</code> (when their CL counterparts have implicit
<code>progn</code>).</p>

        <h3>Details on the serialisation of closures and continuations</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>Closures are serialised by saving information about their lexical
environment at compile-time, and the values of the variables they
close over at runtime. More accurately, the fully macroexpanded
(another possible conflict with codewalked extensions) <em>source</em>
of a function that will reconstruct the complete lexical environment
of the closure, given the values of closed variables, and then
recreate the closure in that environment, is generated. That source is
compiled lazily, when needed, while the server is running. While this
should increase the speed at which programs are compiled, it can be
undesirable. <code>(ensure-all-builders)</code> will compile, in advance, all the
deserialising functions.</p>

<p>Note that, in order to save space, lexical environments that are
identical modulo the equivalence of uninterned symbols are considered
equivalent. In any case, using uninterned symbols for equality
(as opposed to lexical variables or function) is a bad idea, since
their identity is not preserved by a <code>print -&gt; read</code> round-trip. While
using <code>symbol-name</code> would make sense, using strings sounds like a better
idea.</p>

<p>Once the deserialising function has been generated, it is associated
with an unique closure descriptor number and saved in a global hash
table. The descriptor is used during serialisation instead of the
source itself to save space and improve speed. A serialisable closure
is thus defined by a closure descriptor number and a list of the
values it closes over (in an arbitrary but important order).</p>

<p>Since both the descriptors (numbers) and the deserialising functions
(or, rather, their source) can be printed readably, they can easily be
serialised to migrate to another server or to improve load balancing
and redundancy.</p>

<p>Finally, continuations are simply lists of (serialisable) closures,
generated at runtime by the <code>bind</code> and <code>dbind</code> macros, and are printed as
such. Since <code>*print-circle*</code> is bound to <code>T</code> during serialisation
(<code>print</code>ing), sharing <em>within a single continuation</em> is
preserved. Object identity, however, is not, except for interned
symbols.</p>

        <h3>Generating webpages with Common Cold</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>Common Cold doesn't actually offer any special way to generate
webpages. Functions simply have to return strings; how the strings are
generated is irrelevant. What CC does offer is a way to encode
continuations in URLs and a Hunchentoot handler to decode and invoke
them.</p>

<p><code>call-with-continuation-url</code> is a low-level function that takes an input
function, captures the continuation and encodes it in an URL, sets up
a <em>copy</em> of the dynamic bindings in the continuation, and passes its
argument that URL. The function should return a string, the contents
of the webpage. For example,</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun counter ()
  (labels
      ((inner (count)
         (mprogn
          (call-with-continuation-url
           (lambda (k)
             (with-html-output-to-string
                 (*standard-output*)
               (:html
                (:head (:title &quot;Counter&quot;))
                (:body (fmt &quot;Count: ~A~%&quot; count)
                       (:a :href k &quot;Next&quot;))))))
          (inner (1+ count)))))
    (inner 0)))
</pre>
uses cl-who to implement a simple page that counts the number of times
the user has clicked on &quot;Next&quot;. Continuation capture prunes redundant
frames, so tail recursion is safe and will not lead to ever-growing
URLs.

<p><code>send/suspend</code> is a simple macro that wraps <code>call-with-continuation-url</code>
in some syntactic sugar. It should be used as <code>(send/suspend (k)
body...)</code>, where <code>k</code> is the variable to which the continuation's URL will
be bound, and <code>body</code> an implicit <code>progn</code> (not <code>mprogn</code>) that should evaluate
to a string. The example above can be rewritten as:</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun counter ()
  (labels
      ((inner (count)
         (mprogn
          (send/suspend (k)
            (with-html-output-to-string
                (*standard-output*)
              (:html
               (:head (:title &quot;Counter&quot;))
               (:body (fmt &quot;Count: ~A~%&quot; count)
                      (:a :href k &quot;Next&quot;)))))
          (inner (1+ count)))))
    (inner 0)))
</pre>

<p>Note that neither version uses CGI parameters. However, the count
could clearly be one. Common Cold treats special variables as CGI
parameters, exposing them in the URL as such, and updating their
values according to the parameters list when possible. The counter
could thus be rewritten as:</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun counter ()
  (labels
      ((inner (count)
         (mdlet ((count count))
          (send/suspend (k)
            (with-html-output-to-string
                (*standard-output*)
              (:html
               (:head (:title &quot;Counter&quot;))
               (:body (fmt &quot;Count: ~A~%&quot; count)
                      (:a :href k &quot;Next&quot;)))))
          (inner (1+ count)))))
    (inner 0)))
</pre>

<p>The URL will look like <code>[base64-data]?COUNTER:COUNT=0&amp;</code>
(the colon is actually URI-encoded), and, if the value is overridden
in any way (by replacing it, or by appending a binding to
<code>COUNTER:COUNT</code> in the query), it will replace the current one. If,
however, no value is provided as a parameter, the actual value when
the continuation was capture will be used as a default. Hunchentoot's
parameter handling functions can of course also be used.</p>

<p>To register our <code>counter</code> function as a webpage, <code>make-continuation-handler</code>
must be used to create a handler closure, which we can then pass to
Hunchentoot's dispatcher creating functions. For example,</p>

<pre class="example">
(push (hunchentoot:create-prefix-dispatcher
       &quot;/counter/&quot;
       (make-continuation-handler 'counter
                                  &quot;/counter/&quot;
                                  ))
      hunchentoot:*dispatch-table*)
</pre>
will call <code>counter</code> whenever a request is made for &quot;/counter/&quot;. It will
also treat any other URL beginning with &quot;/counter/&quot; as a continuation
URL by clipping out the prefix. A predicate (that returns a true value
when its argument corresponds to a request to <code>'counter</code>) can also be
passed instead of a string as the second argument to
<code>make-continuation-handler</code>.

<p>Continuations are, by default, simply gziped and base64-encoded. While
we are passing closure descriptors instead of actual code, it can
still be dangerous, and probably constitutes an information
leak. <code>register-key</code> should be used to register a private key that will
be used to encrypt and decrypt (symmetrically) the
continuations.</p>

        <h3>Common Cold, my latest hack</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>When someone wants to try continuations-based web pages in Common
Lisp, they're usually directed at UnCommonWeb. A lot of work has gone
into making UCW powerful, but that's not necessarily useful, and can
even make things harder to understand, when one doesn't need all that
power. <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold">Common Cold</a> tries to target that niche, as a simple library (I
certainly wouldn't call it a framework) with a low cost of entry.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, Common Cold (CC) defers to third-party
libraries for nearly everything. It uses <a href="http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/">Hunchentoot</a> straightforwardly
for web serving per se. Functions only have to return pages as
strings, for example, using <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-who/">CL-WHO</a> (which is what CC does internally).
Moreover, instead of striving for a transparent restructuring of code
to extract continuations, explicitly marked macros must be used by the
user. Hopefully, they won't prove to be particularly painful.</p>

<p>Having the programmer annotate its code with special forms instead of
using a codewalker has several advantages. Obviously, we can use the
normal CL macro machinery instead of having to use a codewalker, which
makes the code much less complex. It also makes the restructuring more
transparent and controllable for the programmer. I believe the most
important advantage, however, is simply that the border between
continuations-ful code and normal CL code is always explicit. When
playing with non-native but 'transparent' continuations, the
abstraction tends to leak in various surprising ways (for example,
when passing a continuation-capturing closure to an untransformed
higher-order function), even more so when continuations are serialised,
as in Common Cold.</p>

<p>Serialised continuations are another design goal of Common
Cold. Continuations-based web systems usually keep the continuations
server-side (for a certain amount of time), and only pass an unique
handle to the client. This means that every <em>request</em> consumes server
resources and that URLs always have a somewhat short lifetime. It also
makes load balancing more difficult, unless continuations can be
migrated from one node to another. CC instead uses special forms to
enable serialisable closures (and continuation frames). They are then
encoded in the URL, instead of a session id or of a handle. The system
was designed so that even the deserialisation routines can be
serialised, making migration and load balancing easier to
implement. These continuation URLs have an illimited lifetime, as long
as the webpage functions are not recompiled (and that could be
arranged). They are thus closer to the ideal of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URL</a>s than those
of typical continuations-based web frameworks.</p>

<p>Since serialising and deserialising closures and continuations amounts
to deeply copying them, side effects to lexical bindings often make
little sense. Dynamic bindings (special variables) are instead used
for side-effectful bindings. Since special variables have a dynamic
scope, capturing their latest value in continuations, which can be
seen as capturing the current dynamic environment, seems to make
sense. While assignment is restricted to special variables, it is far
from discouraged. Common Cold establishes a parallel between CGI
parameters and top-level (non-shadowed) dynamic bindings. Their values
are always saved in the continuation URL. However, they may be
overridden, as if by assignment, by CGI parameters with the same
(symbol-)name. These parameters are also exposed in the URL to make
them easier to manipulate. To simplify interactions via forms, only
the rightmost binding for any given parameter is considered.</p>

<p>More on how to actually use Common Cold later; I have a conference to
register at in 6 hours.</p>
