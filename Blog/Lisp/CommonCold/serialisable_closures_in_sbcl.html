        <h3>Hacking serialisable closures with SBCL</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
<p>The key element in <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold/">Common Cold</a> was being able to generate
serialisable closures without having to transform all the lexically
enclosing code. To do that, I had to have access to two things:
all the functions in the lexical environment &mdash; remember that CL is a
Lisp-2, so even if <code>lambda</code> are serialisable, local functions won't
benefit from that automatically (that would also be pretty bad for
performance) &mdash; and all the variables in the enviroment (along with
their values, at runtime).</p>

<p>As would be expected, there is a list of all the lexical variable
definitions (whether they're symbol-macros, lexical variables or
dynamically scoped ones) in the lexical environment (lexenv)
object. After all, most of that is needed for <code>macroexpand</code> to work
correctly. As is logical, the innermost variables are at the
head. Even better: SBCL's compiler seems to always store the
information needed to inline local functions (in the lexenv), which
is, luckily enough, more than enough to recover their source and their
ordering. Some of that information is a bit hidden, however, since the
goals of the compiler are different from ours. What is directly
available in the lexenv object is a list of function 'nodes', with the
most nested function(s) first. Note how there is no direct way to know
how functions and variables are interleaved, or which functions were
defined in the same <code>labels</code> or <code>flet</code> (this is not an issue for
variables, since their value will already have been computed when
we'll unserialise the closures).</p>

<p>To recover that information, we can use the lexenv object associated
with each function node. To group functions together, we simply have
to detect when they close over the same set of functions.  Recursive
functions (defined with <code>labels</code>) also close over themselves, while
those defined with <code>flet</code> don't. Local macros are represented as
closures, so there is no need to get their grouping right, only the
ordering, which is implicit in the list of functions. Note that, since
local functions must be defined where they are bound (CL is a Lisp-2),
we know that simply getting this ordering and grouping right will be
enough to rebuild the correct lexical environment.</p>

<p>In order to know where each variable should be defined, we can, again,
use the lexenv object associated with each function node to find the
outermost (group of) function that closes over that variable. Now,
we can easily generate a form that will have all the function/macros
definition and variable binding/symbol macro definition forms nested
in the right order to recreate the lexical environment. To bind the
variables to the right values, the simplest way is to wrap the form
in a lambda, and take the values as arguments (bound to gensymmed
variables, otherwise there would be issues with variables that
have the same names). There is also the issue of local macros: macro
functions are stored as functions. Trying to store them in the form
would be quite painful: no dumping to fasls, no easy way to share the
data across processes, ... Instead, they are left in the form only to
expand all the macros away with sb-walker, and then removed from the
form. We can finally splice in whatever form we want inside all those
definitions and bindings (before macroexpanding everything). Once we
evaluate the complete form and pass it the values of the lexical
variables, we will have the value of the spliced in form, evaluated
inside a recreation of the lexical environment represented by the
lexenv object.</p>

<p>That still leaves the question of how to get the values of the
variables. Naively, since we have access to all the variables' names, it
seems like we could just generate a form to create a list of all the
variables' values. That dies when lexical scope is used to have two
variables with the same name. We also cannot only capture the value of
innermost variable of each name: the values are needed for surrounding
local functions. The solution that I found is to make sure I get a
fresh lexenv, side effect it to associate all the variable objects
with fresh names, and create the list inside that new environment.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold/closures.lisp">slightly more than 400 LOC</a>, this gives us a generic way to evaluate
forms in serialisable lexical environments, and thus serialisable
closures, and a global registry to unserialise these closures (and to
detect nearly duplicate unserialisers, which may happen with nested
serialisable closures, or serialisable closures inside local functions
that surround another serialisable closure, although that blow-up is,
at most, quadratic in the number of environment serialising forms).</p>
