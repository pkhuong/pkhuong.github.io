<p>When someone wants to try continuations-based web pages in Common
Lisp, they're usually directed at UnCommonWeb. A lot of work has gone
into making UCW powerful, but that's not necessarily useful, and can
even make things harder to understand, when one doesn't need all that
power. <a href="http://www.discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/common-cold">Common Cold</a> tries to target that niche, as a simple library (I
certainly wouldn't call it a framework) with a low cost of entry.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, Common Cold (CC) defers to third-party
libraries for nearly everything. It uses <a href="http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/">Hunchentoot</a> straightforwardly
for web serving per se. Functions only have to return pages as
strings, for example, using <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-who/">CL-WHO</a> (which is what CC does internally).
Moreover, instead of striving for a transparent restructuring of code
to extract continuations, explicitly marked macros must be used by the
user. Hopefully, they won't prove to be particularly painful.</p>

<p>Having the programmer annotate its code with special forms instead of
using a codewalker has several advantages. Obviously, we can use the
normal CL macro machinery instead of having to use a codewalker, which
makes the code much less complex. It also makes the restructuring more
transparent and controllable for the programmer. I believe the most
important advantage, however, is simply that the border between
continuations-ful code and normal CL code is always explicit. When
playing with non-native but 'transparent' continuations, the
abstraction tends to leak in various surprising ways (for example,
when passing a continuation-capturing closure to an untransformed
higher-order function), even more so when continuations are serialised,
as in Common Cold.</p>

<p>Serialised continuations are another design goal of Common
Cold. Continuations-based web systems usually keep the continuations
server-side (for a certain amount of time), and only pass an unique
handle to the client. This means that every <em>request</em> consumes server
resources and that URLs always have a somewhat short lifetime. It also
makes load balancing more difficult, unless continuations can be
migrated from one node to another. CC instead uses special forms to
enable serialisable closures (and continuation frames). They are then
encoded in the URL, instead of a session id or of a handle. The system
was designed so that even the deserialisation routines can be
serialised, making migration and load balancing easier to
implement. These continuation URLs have an illimited lifetime, as long
as the webpage functions are not recompiled (and that could be
arranged). They are thus closer to the ideal of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URL</a>s than those
of typical continuations-based web frameworks.</p>

<p>Since serialising and deserialising closures and continuations amounts
to deeply copying them, side effects to lexical bindings often make
little sense. Dynamic bindings (special variables) are instead used
for side-effectful bindings. Since special variables have a dynamic
scope, capturing their latest value in continuations, which can be
seen as capturing the current dynamic environment, seems to make
sense. While assignment is restricted to special variables, it is far
from discouraged. Common Cold establishes a parallel between CGI
parameters and top-level (non-shadowed) dynamic bindings. Their values
are always saved in the continuation URL. However, they may be
overridden, as if by assignment, by CGI parameters with the same
(symbol-)name. These parameters are also exposed in the URL to make
them easier to manipulate. To simplify interactions via forms, only
the rightmost binding for any given parameter is considered.</p>

<p>More on how to actually use Common Cold later; I have a conference to
register at in 6 hours.</p>
