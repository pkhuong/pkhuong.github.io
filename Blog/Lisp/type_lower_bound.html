<!--l. 11--><p style="text-indent:0em">Nikodemus was intrigued by the <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/sbcl/pkhuong.git/shortlog/refs/heads/type-lower-bound">type-lower-bound</a> branch I pushed on <code style="font-family:monospace">repo.or.cz </code>a
few weeks ago. It&#8217;s a convenience hack that wound up being slightly more intricate
and interesting than planned: a user was complaining that there was no nice way to
muffle <em style="font-style:italic">some </em>optimisation notes. Take

<!--l. 36--><p style="text-indent:0em">
</p><!--l. 38--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   If the user already knows that the best they can do is declare that <code style="font-family:monospace">x </code>is an
<code style="font-family:monospace">integer</code>, there is no way to muffle only the notes that amount to wishing that the
type of <code style="font-family:monospace">x </code>was more precisely known.
</p><!--l. 43--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   My first (failed) attempt tagged <em style="font-style:italic">variables </em>as hopeless (any note mentioning these
variables&#8217; types would then be muffled). I forgot why I couldn&#8217;t make it
work, but I believe it&#8217;s because invisible copies are very common, so that
transforms manipulated <code style="font-family:monospace">lvar</code>s that were mere untagged copies of the tagged
variable.
</p><!--l. 49--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Luckily, we have a well-established mechanism to make properties flow across
copies: the type (propagation) system. Again, my first attempt was to create a type
for hopelessly vague types. However, types must implement all three set operations
(negation, intersection and union), and making that work with such an ad hoc type
wasn&#8217;t an attractive prospect.
</p><!--l. 56--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   This is where type <em style="font-style:italic">lower </em>bounds come in. In CL, types, as exposed through
declarations, are always upper bounds: they are treated as conservative
approximations of the set of values the annotated form, variable, etc. can take. The
conservativeness is necessary because the exact static type is generally undecidable.
In other words, the meaning of <code style="font-family:monospace">(the integer x) </code>is that <code style="font-family:monospace">x </code>can evaluate to
any integer; it could actually only ever evaluate to a <code style="font-family:monospace">fixnum </code>(or any other
subset of <code style="font-family:monospace">integer</code>s), which is what the note in the original example asks
for.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 66--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   If we had a way to also denote lower bounds (e.g. that <code style="font-family:monospace">x </code>can take <code style="font-family:monospace">(not fixnum)</code>
values) on the exact static type of forms, compiler notes could be tested
against these lower bounds to determine when the programmer knows that
the declared or derived type cannot be improved enough for a transform
to fire. In the original example, this would amount to declaring that <code style="font-family:monospace">x</code>&#8217;s
exact static type is between <code style="font-family:monospace">fixnum </code>(exclusively) and <code style="font-family:monospace">integer </code>(inclusively),
or, equivalently, that <code style="font-family:monospace">x </code>will always be an <code style="font-family:monospace">integer</code>, and will sometimes not
be a <code style="font-family:monospace">fixnum</code>. The note is then obviously moot, and can be muffled by the
compiler.
</p><!--l. 77--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   Unlike ad hoc &#8220;hopeless&#8221; types, intersection and union of lower bound types
(really, range of types, since lower bound types are always accompanied by an upper
bound) are straightforward and theoretically sound. The only issue is with type
negation. Since this is all for convenience, I decided to just punt and drop the lower
bound before negating.
</p><!--l. 84--><p style="text-indent:1.5em">   The branch, as pushed on <code style="font-family:monospace">repo.or.cz</code>, seems to be working. In order to keep
changes to a minimum, regular types are treated as having an implicit lower bound of
<code style="font-family:monospace">nil</code>, and range types (with a non-trivial lower bound) are aggressively converted to
regular types. This gives the muffling effect for some interesting simple cases, and
reverts to the old behaviour very quickly. There are probably hidden bugs (both in
the code and in the design), but since they could only be triggered by using the
extension, I&#8217;m not <em style="font-style:italic">too </em>worried.
</p>
   <h3><a id="x1-1000"></a>N.B. This isn&#8217;t actually useful for compilation speed</h3>
<!--l. 94--><p style="text-indent:0em">I originally thought type lower bounds could be useful to improve compilation speed:
by keeping around both lower and upper bounds, we are able to overapproximate
types even in the presence of type negation. Once I implemented a quick prototype,
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/sbcl/pkhuong.git/shortlog/refs/heads/ir1-widening">ir1-widening</a>, I realised we don&#8217;t need lower bounds at all: we only have to make sure
we only ever approximate types once we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;ll never be negated.
Actually, what would be even more useful is a way to compute approximate
unions and intersections quickly, instead of widening types after the fact.
