    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem">continuous knapsack problem</a> may be the simplest non-trivial linear
programming problem:</p>

<p>\[\max_{x \in [0, 1]^n} p’x\]
subject to
\[w’x \leq b.\]</p>

<p>It has a linear objective, one constraint, and each decision variable
is bounded to ensure the optimum exists.  Note the key difference from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0/1_knapsack_problem">binary knapsack problem</a>: decision variables are allowed to take any
value between 0 and 1.  In other words, we can, e.g., stick half of
a profitable but large item in the knapsack. That’s why this knapsack
problem can be solved in linear time.</p>

<h2 id="dual-to-primal-is-reasonable">Dual to primal is reasonable</h2>

<p>Duality also lets us determine the shape of all optimal solutions to
this problem.  For each item \(i\) with weight \(w_i\) and profit
\(p_i\), let its profit ratio be \(r_i = p_i / w_i,\)
and let \(\lambda^\star\) be the optimal dual (Lagrange or linear)
multiplier associated with the capacity constraint \(w’x \leq b.\)
If \(\lambda^\star = 0,\) we simply take all items with a positive
profit ratio (\(r_i &gt; 0\)) and a non-negative weight \(w_i \geq 0.\)
Otherwise, every item with a profit ratio \(r_i &gt; \lambda^\star\)
will be at its weight upper bound (1 if \(w_i \geq 0\), 0
otherwise), and items with \(r_i &lt; \lambda^\star\) will instead be
at their lower bound (0 of \(w_i \leq 0\), and 1 otherwise).</p>

<p>Critical items, items with \(r_i = \lambda^\star,\) will take any value
that results in \(w’x = b.\) Given \(\lambda^\star,\) we can
derive the sum of weights for non-critical items; divide the
remaining capacity for critical items by the total weight of critical
items, and let that be the value for every critical item (with the
appropriate sign for the weight).</p>

<p>For example, if we have capacity \(b = 10,\) and the sum of weights
for non-critical items in the knsapsack is \(8,\) we’re left with another
two units of capacity to distribute however we want among
critical items (they all have the same profit ratio \(r_i =
\lambda^\star,\) so it doesn’t matter where that capacity goes).  Say
critical items with a positive weight have a collective weight of 4;
we could then assign a value of \(2 / 4 = 0.5\) to the corresponding
decision variable (and 0 for critical items with a non-positive
weight).</p>

<p>We could instead have \(b = 10,\) and the sum of weights for
non-critical items in the knapsack \(12\): we must find two units of
capacity among critical items (they all cost \(r_i = \lambda^\star\)
per unit, so it doesn’t matter which).  If critical items with a
negative weight have a collective weight of \(-3,\) we could assign
a value of \(-2 / -3 = 0.6\overline{6}\) to the corresponding decision
variables, and 0 for critical items with a non-negative weight.</p>

<p>The last case highlights something important about the knapsack: in
general, we can’t assume that the weights <em>or profits</em> are positive.
We could have an item with a non-positive weight and non-negative
profit (that’s always worth taking), an item with positive weight and
negative profit (never interesting), or weights and profits of the
same sign.  The last case is the only one that calls for actual
decision making.  Classically, items with negative weight and profit
are rewritten away, by assuming they’re taken in the knapsack, and
replacing them with a decision variable for the complementary decision
of removing that item from the knapsack (i.e., removing the additional
capacity in order to improve the profit).  I’ll try to treat them
directly as much as possible, because that reduction can be a
significant fraction of solve times in practice.</p>

<p>The characterisation of optimal solutions above makes it easy to
directly handle elements with a negative weight: just find the optimal
multiplier, compute the contribution of non-critical elements (with
decision variables at a bound) to the left-hand side of the capacity
constraint, separately sums the negative and positive weights for
critical elements, then do a final pass to distribute the remaining
capacity to critical elements (and 0-weight / 0-value elements if one
wishes).</p>

<h2 id="solving-the-dual-looks-like-selection">Solving the dual looks like selection</h2>

<p>Finding the optimal multiplier \(\lambda^\star\) is similar to a
selection problem: the value is either 0 (the capacity constraint is
redundant), or one of the profit ratios \(r_i,\) and, given a
multiplier value \(\lambda,\) we can determine if it’s too high or
too low in linear time.  If the non-critical elements yield a left-hand
side such that critical elements
can’t add enough capacity (i.e., no solution with the optimal form can
be feasible), \(\lambda\) is too low.  If the maximum weight of
potentially optimal solutions is too low, \(\lambda\) is too high.</p>

<p>We can thus sort the items by profit ratio \(r_i\), compute the
total weight corresponding to each ratio with a prefix sum (with a
pre-pass to sum all negative weights), and perform a linear (or
binary) search to find the critical profit ratio.
Moreover, the status of non-critical items is monotonic as
\(\lambda\) grows: if an item with positive weight is taken at
\(\lambda_0\), it is also taken for every \(\lambda \leq
\lambda_0\), and a negative-weight item that’s taken at
\(\lambda_0\) is also taken for every \(\lambda \geq \lambda_0.\)
This means we can adapt selection algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect">Quickselect</a> to solve
the continuous knapsack problem in linear time.</p>

<p>I’m looking at large instances, so I would like to run these
algorithms in parallel or even distributed on multiple machines, and
ideally use GPUs or SIMD extensions.  Unfortunately, selection doesn’t
parallelise very well: we can run a distributed quickselect where
every processor partitions the data in its local RAM, but that still
requires a logarithmic number of iterations.</p>

<h2 id="selection-looks-like-quantile-estimation-does-the-dual">Selection looks like quantile estimation; does the dual?</h2>

<p><a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27685/can-someone-explain-lazyselect">Lazy Select</a> offers a completely different angle for the selection
problem.  Selecting the \(k\)th smallest element from a list of
\(n\) elements is the same as finding the \(k / n\)th quantile<sup id="fnref:abuse-of-language" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abuse-of-language" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in
that list of \(n\) elements.  We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">concentration bounds</a><sup id="fnref:binomial" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:binomial" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to estimate quantiles from a sample of, e.g.,
\(m = n^{3/4}\) elements: the population quantile value is very
probably between the \(qm - \frac{\log m}{\sqrt{m}}\)th and \(qm +
\frac{\log m}{\sqrt{m}}\)th values of the sample.  Moreover, this
range very probably includes at most \(\mathcal{O}(n^{3/4})\)
elements<sup id="fnref:same-bounds" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:same-bounds" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, so a second pass suffices to buffer all the
elements around the quantile, and find the exact quantile.  Even with
a much smaller sample size \(m = \sqrt{n},\) we would only need four
passes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we can’t directly use that correspondence between
selection and quantile estimation for the continuous knapsack.</p>

<p>I tried to apply a similar idea by sampling the knapsack elements
equiprobably, and extrapolating from a solution to the sample.  For
every \(\lambda,\) we can derive a selection function 
\(f_\lambda (i) = I[r_i \geq \lambda]w_i\) 
(invert the condition if the weight is negative),
and scale up \(\sum_i f(i)\) from the sample to the population).
As long as we sample independently of \(f\), we can reuse the
same sample for all \(f_\lambda.\)
The difficulty here is that, while the error for Lazy Select
scales as a function of \(n,\) the equivalent bounds with
variable weights are a function of \(n(|\max_i w_i| + |\min_i w_i|)^2.\)
That doesn’t seem necessarily practical; scaling with \(\sum_i |w_i|\)
would be more reasonable.</p>

<p>Good news: we can hit that, thanks to linearity.</p>

<p>Let’s assume weights are all integers.  Any item with weight \(w_i\)
is equivalent to \(w_i\) subitems with unit weight (or \(-w_i\)
elements with negative unit weight), and the same profit ratio \(r_i\),
i.e., profit \(p_i / |w_i|\).  The range of <em>subitem</em> weights is now a constant.</p>

<p>We could sample uniformly from the subitems with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli</a> for each
subitem, but that’s clearly linear time in the sum of weights, rather
than the number of elements.  If we wish to sample roughly \(m\) elements
from a total weight \(W = \sum_i |w_i|,\) we can instead determine how
many subitems (units of weight) to skip before sampling with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">Geometric</a> of
success probability \(m / W.\) This shows us how to lift the
integrality constraint on weights: sample from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">Exponential</a>
with the same parameter \(m / W!\)</p>

<p>That helps, but we could still end up spending much more than constant
time on very heavy elements.  The trick is to deterministically
special-case these elements: stash any element with large weight
\(w_i \geq W / m\) to the side, exactly once.  By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markov’s inequality</a>,<sup id="fnref:pigeonhole" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pigeonhole" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
we know there aren’t too many heavy elements: at most \(m.\)</p>

<h2 id="lets-test-this-out">Let’s test this out</h2>

<p>The heart of the estimation problem can be formalised as follows:
given a list of elements \(i \in [n]\) with weight \(w_i \geq 0\),
generate a sample of \(m \leq n\) elements ahead of time. After the
sample has been generated, we want to accept an arbitrary predicate
\(p \in \{0,1\}^n\) and estimate \(\sum_{i\in [n]} p(i) w_i.\)</p>

<p>We just had a sketch of an algorithm for this problem.  Let’s see
what it looks like in Python.  The initial sample logic has to
determine the total weight, and sample items with probability
proportional to their weight.  Items heavier than the cutoff are not
considered in the sample and instead saved to an auxiliary list.</p>

<p>We can assemble the resulting sample (and list of “large” elements) to
compute a lower bound on the weight of items that satisfy any
predicate that’s independent of the sampling decisions.  The value for
large elements is trivial: we have a list of all large elements.
We can subtract the weight of all large elements from the total item
weight, and determine how much we have to extrapolate up.</p>

compure a lower bound on the weight of items that satisfy a predicate,
and compare that with the real lower bound.</p>

<p>How do we test that? Far too often, I see tests for randomised
algorithms where the success rate is computed over randomly generated
inputs.  That’s too weak!  For example, this approach could lead us to accept
that the identity function is a randomised sort function, with success
probability \(\frac{1}{n!}.\)</p>

<p>The property we’re looking for is that, for any input, the success
rate (with the expectation over the pseudorandom sampling decisions)
is as high as requested.</p>

<p>For a given input (list of items and predicate), we can use the <a href="http://pvk.ca/Blog/2018/07/06/testing-slo-type-properties-with-the-confidence-sequence-method/">Confidence sequence method (CSM)</a>
to confirm that the lower bound is valid at least
\(1 - \alpha\) of the time.</p>

<p>Again, we use <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html">Hypothesis</a> to generate inputs, and
the <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/csm">Confidence sequence method (available in C, Common Lisp, and Python)</a> to check that the lower bound is
valid with probability at least \(1 - \alpha\).  The CSM tests
for this statistical property with power 1 and adjustable error rate
(in our case, one in a million): we only provide a generator
for success values, and the driver adaptively determines when it makes
sense to make a call and stop generating more data, while accounting
for multiple hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>TL;DR: the estimation algorithm for individual sampling passes works,
and the combination of <a href="https://hypothesis.works/">Hypothesis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/csm">Confidence Sequence Method</a>
lets us painlessly test for a statistical property.</p>

<p>We can iteratively use this sampling procedure to derive lower and
(symmetrically) upper bounds for the optimal Lagrange multiplier
\(\lambda^\star,\) and Hoeffding’s inequality lets us control the
probability that the lower and upper bounds are valid.  Typically,
we’d use a tolerance of \(\sqrt{\log(n) / n},\) for an error
rate of \(1 / n^2.\) I prefer to simply use something like \(7 /
\sqrt{n}:\) the error rate is then less than \(10^{-42},\)
orders of manitude smaller than the probability of hardware failure in any given
nanosecond.<sup id="fnref:memory-error" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:memory-error" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
We can still check for failure of our Las Vegas algorithm,
but if something went wrong, it’s much more likely that we detected
a hardware failure than anything else.  It’s like running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_PI">SuperPi</a>
to stress test a computer, except the work is useful. 😉</p>

<h2 id="repeat-as-necessary-to-solve-a-knapsack">Repeat as necessary to solve a knapsack</h2>

<p>How many sampling passes do we need? Our bounds are in terms of the
sum of item weight: if we let our sample size be in
\(\Theta(\sqrt{n}),\) the sum of weights \(\sum_i |w_i|\) for
unfathomed items (that may or may not be chosen depending on the exact
optimal multiplier \(\lambda^\star\) in the current range) will very
probably shrink by a factor of \(\Omega(n^{1/4}).\) The initial sum can, in
the worst case, be exponentially larger than the bitlength of the
input, so even a division by \(n^{1/4}\) isn’t necessarily that
great.</p>

<p>I intend to apply this Lazy Linear Knapsack algorithm on subproblems in
a more interesting solver, and I know that the sum of weights is
bounded by the size of the initial problem, so that’s good enough for
me!  After a constant (\(\approx 4\)) number of passes, the
difference in item weight between the lower and upper bound on
\(\lambda^\star\) should also be at most 1.  One or two additional
passes will get me near optimality (e.g., within \(10^{-4}\)),
and the lower bound on \(\lambda^\star\) should thus yield
a super-optimal solution that’s infeasible by at most \(10^{-4},\)
which is, for my intended usage (again), good enough.</p>

<p>Given an optimal enough \(\lambda^\star,\) we can construct an
explicit solution in one pass, plus a simple fixup for critical items.
This Lazy Knapsack seems pretty reasonable for parallel or GPU
computing: each sampling pass only needs to read the items (i.e., no
partitioning-like shuffling) before writing a fraction of the data to
a sample buffer, and we only need a constant number of passes (around
6 or 7) in the worst case.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><small><em>Fixed notation issues in the “Faster multiset updates” section. Thank you Joonas.</em></small></p>

<p>Let’s say you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset">multiset (bag)</a> of “reals” (floats or rationals),
where each value is a sampled observations.
It’s easy to augment any implementation of the multiset ADT
to also return the sample mean of the values in the multiset in constant time:
track the sum of values in the multiset, as they are individually added and removed.
This requires one accumulator
and a counter for the number of observations in the multiset (i.e., constant space),
and adds a constant time overhead to each update.</p>

<p>It’s not as simple when you also need the sample variance of the multiset \(X\), i.e.,</p>

<p>\[\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum\sb{x \in X} (x - \hat{x})\sp{2},\]</p>

<p>where \(n = |X|\) is the sample size and
\(\hat{x}\) is the sample mean \(\sum\sb{x\in X} x/n,\)
ideally with constant query time, 
and constant and update time overhead.</p>

<p>One could try to apply the textbook equality</p>

<p>\[s\sp{2} = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}\left[n\sum\sb{x\in X} x\sp{2} - \left(\sum\sb{x\in X} x\right)\sp{2}\right].\]</p>

<p>However, as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu-HAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+art+of+computer+programming+volume+2&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja5aGCzpPmAhWjY98KHYCGBksQuwUwAXoECAQQBw#v=onepage&amp;q=welford%20technometrics&amp;f=false">Knuth notes in TAoCP volume 2</a>,
this expression loses a lot of precision to round-off in floating point:
in extreme cases, the difference might be negative
(and we know the variance is never negative).
More commonly, we’ll lose precision
when the sampled values are clustered around a large mean.
For example, the sample standard deviation of <code>1e8</code> and <code>1e8 - 1</code>
is <code>1</code>, same as for <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.
However, the expression above would evaluate that to <code>0.0</code>, even in double precision:
while <code>1e8</code> is comfortably within range for double floats,
its square <code>1e16</code> is outside the range where all integers are represented exactly.</p>

<p>Knuth refers to a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.302.7503&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">better behaved recurrence by Welford</a>, where
a running sample mean is subtracted from each new observation
before squaring.
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/standard_deviation/">John Cook has a <code>C++</code> implementation</a>
of the recurrence that adds observations to a sample variance in constant time.
In Python, this streaming algorithm looks like this.</p>

<p>That’s all we need for insert-only multisets,
but does not handle removals;
if only we had removals,
we could always implement updates (replacement)
as a removal and an insertion.</p>

<p>Luckily, <code>StreamingVariance.observe</code> looks invertible.
It’s shouldn’t be hard to recover the previous sample mean, given <code>v</code>,
and, given the current and previous sample means,
we can re-evaluate <code>(v - old_mean) * (v - self.mean)</code> and
subtract it from <code>self.var_sum</code>.</p>

<p>Let \(\hat{x}\sp{\prime}\) be the sample mean after <code>observe(v)</code>.
We can derive the previous sample mean \(\hat{x}\) from \(v\):</p>

<p>\[(n - 1)\hat{x} = n\hat{x}\sp{\prime} - v \Leftrightarrow \hat{x} = \hat{x}\sp{\prime} + \frac{\hat{x}\sp{\prime} - v}{n-1}.\]</p>

<p>This invertibility means that we can undo calls to <code>observe</code> in
LIFO order.  We can’t handle arbitrary multiset updates, only a
stack of observation.  That’s still better than nothing.</p>

<p>Before going any further, let’s test this.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-variancestack">Testing the <code>VarianceStack</code></h2>

<p>The best way to test the <code>VarianceStack</code> is to execute a series of
<code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> calls, and compare the results of <code>get_mean</code> and
<code>get_variance</code> with batch reference implementations.</p>

<p>I could hardcode calls in unit tests.
However, that quickly hits diminishing returns in terms of
marginal coverage VS developer time.
Instead, I’ll be lazy, completely skip unit tests,
and rely on <a href="https://hypothesis.works/">Hypothesis</a>,
its <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stateful.html">high level “stateful” testing API</a>
in particular.</p>

<p>We’ll keep track of the values pushed and popped off the observation stack
in the driver: we must make sure they’re matched in LIFO order,
and we need the stack’s contents to compute the reference mean and variance.
We’ll also want to compare the results with reference implementations,
modulo some numerical noise.  Let’s try to be aggressive and bound
the number of float values between the reference and the actual results.</p>

<p>This initial driver does not even use the <code>VarianceStack</code> yet.
All it does is push values to the reference stack,
pop values when the stack has something to pop,
and check that the reference implementations match themselves after each call:
I want to first shake out any bug in the test harness itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1095662615223848960">Not surprisingly</a>,
Hypothesis does find an issue in the reference implementation:</p>

<pre><code>Falsifying example:
state = VarianceStackDriver()
state.push(v=0.0)
state.push(v=2.6815615859885194e+154)
state.teardown()
</code></pre>

<p>We get a numerical <code>OverflowError</code> in <code>reference_variance</code>: <code>2.68...e154 / 2</code>
is slightly greater than <code>sqrt(sys.float_info.max) = 1.3407807929942596e+154</code>,
so taking the square of that value errors out instead of returning infinity.</p>

<p>Let’s start by clamping the range of the generated floats.</p>

<p>Now that the test harness doesn’t find fault in itself,
let’s hook in the <code>VarianceStack</code>, and see what happens
when only <code>push</code> calls are generated (i.e., first test
only the standard streaming variance algorithm).</p>

<p>This already fails horribly.</p>

<pre><code>Falsifying example:

state.push(v=1.0)
state.push(v=1.488565707357403e+138)
state.teardown()

</code></pre>

<p>The reference finds a variance of <code>5.54e275</code>,
which is very much not the streaming computation’s <code>1.108e276</code>.
We can manually check that the reference is wrong:
it’s missing the <code>n - 1</code> correction term in the denominator.</p>

<p>We should use this updated reference.</p>

<p>And now things fail in new and excitingly numerical ways.</p>

<pre><code>Falsifying example:
state = VarianceStackDriver()
state.push(v=0.0)
state.push(v=0.00014142319560050964)
state.push(v=14188.9609375)
state.pop()
state.teardown()
F
</code></pre>

<p>This counter-example fails with the online variance returning <code>0.0</code> instead of <code>1e-8</code>.
That’s not unexpected:
removing (the square of) a large value from a running sum
spells catastrophic cancellation.
It’s also not <em>that</em> bad for my use case,
where I don’t expect to observe very large values.</p>

<p>Another problem for our test harness is that
floats are very dense around <code>0.0</code>, and 
I’m ok with small (around <code>1e-8</code>) absolute error
because the input and output will be single floats.</p>

<p>Let’s relax <code>assert_almost_equal</code>, and
restrict generated observations to fall
in \([-2\sp{-12}, 2\sp{12}].\)</p>

<p>With all these tweaks to make sure we generate easy (i.e., <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1095663620422332416">interesting</a>)
test cases, Hypothesis fails to find a failure after its default time budget.</p>

<p>I’m willing to call that a victory.</p>

<h2 id="from-stack-to-full-multiset">From stack to full multiset</h2>

<p>We have tested code to undo updates in Welford’s classic streaming variance algorithm.
Unfortunately, inverting <code>push</code>es away only works for LIFO edits,
and we’re looking for arbitrary inserts and removals (and updates) to a multiset
of observations.</p>

<p>However, both the mean \(\hat{x} = \sum\sb{x\in X} x/n\) and 
the centered second moment \(\sum\sb{x\in X}(x - \hat{x})\sp{2}\)
are order-independent:
they’re just sums over all observations.
Disregarding round-off, we’ll find the same mean and second moment regardless
of the order in which the observations were pushed in.
Thus, whenever we wish to remove an observation from the multiset,
we can assume it was the last one added to the estimates,
and pop it off.</p>

<p>We think we know how to implement running mean and variance for a multiset of observations.
How do we test that with Hypothesis?</p>

<p>The hardest part about testing dictionary (map)-like interfaces
is making sure to generate valid identifiers when removing values.
As it turns out, Hypothesis has built-in support for this important use case,
with its <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stateful.html#rule-based-state-machines">Bundles</a>.
We’ll use that to test a dictionary from observation name to observation value,
augmented to keep track of the current mean and variance of all values.</p>

<p>Each call to <code>add_entry</code> will either go to <code>update_entry</code> if
the key already exists, or add an observation to the dictionary
and streaming estimator.  If we have a new key, it is added
to the <code>keys</code> Bundle; calls to <code>del_entry</code> and <code>update_entry</code>
draw keys from this Bundle.  When we remove an entry, it’s
also consumed from the <code>keys</code> Bundle.</p>

<p>Hypothesis finds no fault with our new implementation of dictionary-with-variance,
but <code>update</code> seems like it could be much faster and numerically stable,
and I intend to mostly use this data structure for calls to <code>update</code>.</p>

<h2 id="faster-multiset-updates">Faster multiset updates</h2>

<p>The key operation for my use-case is to update one observation
by replacing its <code>old</code> value with a <code>new</code> one.
We can maintain the estimator by popping <code>old</code> away and pushing <code>new</code> in,
but this business with updating the number of observation <code>n</code> and
rescaling everything seems like a lot of numerical trouble.</p>

<p>We should be able to do better.</p>

<p>We’re replacing the multiset of sampled observations \(X\) with
\(X\sp{\prime} = X \setminus \{\textrm{old}\} \cup \{\textrm{new}\}.\)
It’s easy to maintain the mean after this update: \(\hat{x}\sp{\prime} = \hat{x} + (\textrm{new} - \textrm{old})/n.\)</p>

<p>The update to <code>self.var_sum</code>, the sum of squared differences from the mean, is trickier.
We start with \(v = \sum\sb{x\in X} (x - \hat{x})\sp{2},\)
and we wish to find \(v\sp{\prime} = \sum\sb{x\sp{\prime}\in X\sp{\prime}} (x\sp{\prime} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2}.\)</p>

<p>Let \(\delta = \textrm{new} - \textrm{old}\) and \(\delta\sb{\hat{x}} = \delta/n.\)
We have
\[\sum\sb{x\in X} (x - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2} = \sum\sb{x\in X} [(x - \hat{x}) - \delta\sb{\hat{x}}]\sp{2},\]
and
\[[(x - \hat{x}) - \delta\sb{\hat{x}}]\sp{2} = (x - \hat{x})\sp{2} - 2\delta\sb{\hat{x}} (x - \hat{x}) + \delta\sb{\hat{x}}\sp{2}.\]</p>

<p>We can reassociate the sum, and find</p>

<p>\[\sum\sb{x\in X} (x - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2} = \sum\sb{x\in X} (x - \hat{x})\sp{2} - 2\delta\sb{\hat{x}} \left(\sum\sb{x \in X} x - \hat{x}\right) + n \delta\sb{\hat{x}}\sp{2}\]</p>

<p>Once we notice that \(\hat{x} = \sum\sb{x\in X} x/n,\)
it’s clear that the middle term sums to zero, and we find
the very reasonable</p>

<p>\[v\sb{\hat{x}\sp{\prime}} = \sum\sb{x\in X} (x - \hat{x})\sp{2} + n \delta\sb{\hat{x}}\sp{2} = v + \delta \delta\sb{\hat{x}}.\]</p>

<p>This new accumulator \(v\sb{\hat{x}\sp{\prime}}\) corresponds to the sum of the
squared differences between the old observations \(X\) and the new mean \(\hat{x}\sp{\prime}\).
We still have to update one observation from <code>old</code> to <code>new</code>.
The remaining adjustment to \(v\) (<code>self.var_sum</code>) corresponds to
going from \((\textrm{old} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2}\)
to \((\textrm{new} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2},\)
where \(\textrm{new} = \textrm{old} + \delta.\)</p>

<p>After a bit of algebra, we get
\[(\textrm{new} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2} = [(\textrm{old} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime}) + \delta]\sp{2} = (\textrm{old} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2} + \delta (\textrm{old} - \hat{x} + \textrm{new} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime}).\]</p>

<p>The adjusted \(v\sb{\hat{x}\sp{\prime}}\) already includes
\((\textrm{old} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime})\sp{2}\)
in its sum, so we only have to add the last term
to obtain the final updated <code>self.var_sum</code></p>

<p>\[v\sp{\prime} = v\sb{\hat{x}\sp{\prime}} + \delta (\textrm{old} - \hat{x} + \textrm{new} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime}) = v + \delta [2 (\textrm{old} - \hat{x}) + \textrm{new} - \hat{x}\sp{\prime}].\]</p>

<p>That’s our final implementation for <code>VarianceBag.update</code>,
for which Hypothesis also fails to find failures.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-do-you-trust-testing">How much do you trust testing?</h2>

<p>We have automated property-based tests and some human-checked proofs.
Ship it?</p>

<p>I was initially going to ask a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">CAS</a>
to check my reformulations,
but the implicit \(\forall\) looked messy.
Instead, I decided to check the induction hypothesis implicit in
<code>VarianceBag.update</code>, and enumerate all cases up to a certain number
of values with <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki">Z3</a> in IPython.</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: from z3 import *
In [2]: x, y, z, new_x = Reals("x y z new_x")
In [3]: mean = (x + y + z) / 3
In [4]: var_sum = sum((v - mean) * (v - mean) for v in (x, y, z))
In [5]: delta = new_x - x
In [6]: new_mean = mean + delta / 3
In [7]: delta_mean = delta / 3
In [8]: adjustment = delta * (2 * (x - mean) + (delta - delta_mean))
In [9]: new_var_sum = var_sum + adjustment

# We have our expressions. Let's check equivalence for mean, then var_sum
In [10]: s = Solver() 
In [11]: s.push()
In [12]: s.add(new_mean != (new_x + y + z) / 3)
In [13]: s.check()
Out[13]: unsat  # No counter example of size 3 for the updated mean
In [14]: s.pop()

In [15]: s.push()
In [16]: s.add(new_mean == (new_x + y + z) / 3)  # We know the mean matches
In [17]: s.add(new_var_sum != sum((v - new_mean) * (v - new_mean) for v in (new_x, y, z)))
In [18]: s.check()
Out[18]: unsat  # No counter example of size 3 for the updated variance
</code></pre>

<p>Given this script, it’s a small matter of programming to generalise
from 3 values (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>) to any fixed number of values, and
generate all small cases up to, e.g., 10 values.</p>

<p>I find the most important thing when it comes to using automated proofs
is to insert errors and confirm we can find the bugs we’re looking for.</p>

<p>I did that by manually mutating the expressions for <code>new_mean</code> and <code>new_var_sum</code>
in <code>updated_expressions</code>.  This let me find a simple bug in the initial
implementation of <code>test_num_var</code>: I used <code>if not result</code> instead of <code>result != unsat</code>,
and both <code>sat</code> and <code>unsat</code> are truthy.  The code initially failed to flag a failure
when <code>z3</code> found a counter-example for our correctness condition!</p>

<h2 id="and-now-im-satisfied">And now I’m satisfied</h2>

<p>I have code to augment an arbitrary multiset or dictionary with
a running estimate of the mean and variance;
that code is based on a classic recurrence,
with some new math checked by hand,
with automated tests,
and with some exhaustive checking of small inputs (to which I claim most bugs can be reduced).</p>

<p>I’m now pretty sure the code works, but there’s another more obviously correct way to solve that update problem.
This <a href="https://prod-ng.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/2008/086212.pdf">2008 report by Philippe Pébay</a><sup id="fnref:pebay2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pebay2016" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
presents formulas to compute the mean, variance, and arbitrary moments
in one pass,
and shows how to combine accumulators,
a useful operation in parallel computing.</p>

<p>We could use these formulas to <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2010/11/statistical-fingertrees.html">augment an arbitrary \(k\)-ary tree</a>
and re-combine the merged accumulator as we go back up the (search)
tree from the modified leaf to the root.
The update would be much more stable (we only add and merge observations),
and incur logarithmic time overhead (with linear space overhead).
However, given the same time budget, and a <em>logarithmic</em> space overhead,
we could also implement the constant-time update with arbitrary precision
software floats, and probably guarantee even better precision.</p>

<p>The constant-time update I described in this post demanded more effort to convince myself
of its correctness, but I think it’s always a better option than
an augmented tree for serial code, especially if initial values
are available to populate the accumulators with batch-computed
mean and variance.
I’m pretty sure the code works, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/pkhuong/549106fc8194c0d1fce85b00c9e192d5">it’s up in this gist</a>.
I’ll be re-implementing it in C++
because that’s the language used by the project that lead me to this problem;
feel free to steal that gist.</p>
