<p>EDIT: Added clarifications, modifed the wording a bit, and linked to
the source (see bottom of post).</p>

<p>Cleaning up the SSE work, making it useful and using it in something
interesting would take too much time given my current situation. SSE
intrinsics, part 2, will have to wait.  However, there's always time
for a couple experiments induced by reading papers.  <em>d-left</em> hashing
seems to have gotten some attention in the last couple years.
Unfortunately, I have a hard time mapping from the papers to
real-world performance.</p>

<p>The idea behind <em>d-left</em> hashing is simple. Insertions work as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Split our hash table in <em>d</em> equal sections (typically two, the left
and the right halves), and order the sections from left to right
arbitrarily.</li>

<li>Associate <em>d</em> independent hash values to the key, h_1, h_2, ... h_d.</li>

<li>Use the <em>d</em> hash values to find a bucket in each section of the hash
table, and put the key-value pair in the least loaded bucket; break
ties <em>not randomly</em>, but by taking the bucket in the leftmost section
(as per the arbitrary ordering established in 1.).</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure for lookups is easily derived from the above.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, breaking ties unfairly behaves slightly better than
random tie-breaking. Mitzenmacher's, Richa's and Sitaraman's
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results</a>
covers the topic fairly extensively.</p>

<p>Having a choice in which bucket to use gives a substantial (theoretic)
advantage over having a single hash function (<em>d</em> = 1). Assuming ideal
hash functions, we expect the greatest number of elements in the
buckets of a regular bucketed hash table with <em>n</em> buckets in which we
insert <em>n</em>  elements to be around log n/log log n; for <em>d</em> &gt; 1, that's log
log n/log d + Theta(1). Clearly, setting <em>d</em> to 2 yields a great
improvement over <em>d</em> = 1, and <em>d</em> &gt; 2 only shaves a constant factor.</p>

<p>I don't doubt the theory, but &quot;approximately&quot; and &quot;Theta(1)&quot; aren't
negligible for hash tables, where we're pretty much always fighting
for better constant factors regarding space usage. Luckily, this
idealised ball and bin setting is easily to simulate (the hash
functions are just PRNGs here and in the sequel).  I ran numerical
experiments with <em>n</em> = 2^4, 2^5, ... 2^20, each time with 1000
repetition (I'll use the same number of independent repetitions
throughout the post). The distribution of bucket sizes is fairly
constant over the range, so I'll only show the results for <em>n</em> = 2^20.</p>

<pre class="example">
Size  1-left (%)  2-left (%)
 0      36.8        22.8
 1      36.8        54.8
 2      18.4        21.9
 3       6.1         0.4
 4       1.5         0.0
 5       0.3          0
 6       0.1          0
         ...         ...
12       0.0          0
13        0           0
</pre>

<p>The theoretical results predict a maximal size of 5~6 for <em>1-left</em> and
3~4 for <em>2-left</em>, which is pretty close to what we observe here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't find that result satisfying: how will the
buckets be implemented?  If they're preallocated, we can only tell
that the buckets would have to all be 3-entry deep (assuming a short
overflow list to supplement the 6e-6% buckets with more than 3
entries) for all 2^20 entries to fit.  That uses 3 times as much space
as the actual data!  Buckets implemented as linked lists or allocated
adaptively might use less space, but, again, the constant factors are
extremely important, since we expect to have relatively shallow
buckets; the additional pointers might outweigh most or all the space
savings. The results above are a good hint that <em>2-left</em> hashing will
perform much better than regular buckets, but otherwise don't seem
particularly telling.</p>

<p>I found it interesting to compare the space efficiency of <em>2-left</em> hash
tables to that of a regular, even naive, hash table with linear open
addressing. Again, the experiments fills 2^20 bins with 2^20
balls (the hash functions are again PRNGs), so the load is the inverse
of the space usage. However, each bin can only contain up to 1
ball; when full, we try to put the ball in the next bin, up to a
certain probe length limit (so we examine at most a small fixed number
of bins). We won't be able to place all the balls (without a lot of
luck, anyway), but it'll be interesting to see how much of the 2^20
balls will fit.  I tried that with a maximal probe length of 16, and
another one with again a maximal probe length of 16, but also an
overflow list of at most 8 entries. The overflow list is used to host
a small number of entries that exceed the probe length limit (or
bucket size) instead of aborting immediately. Since very few entries
hit the limit, a short list is often enough to substantially increase
the expected load.</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>With linear open addressing, we can already expect to have
approximately the same space overhead as <em>2-left</em> tables with
preallocated buckets if we wanted to guarantee that all 2^20 entries
fit. The small overflow list has two effects: the worst case is
greatly improved, and the mode (and average) is also considerably
better. The expected space overhead is now even lower, probably close
to what <em>2-left</em> with buckets as linked lists would achieve! However,
probing 16 cells might be a bit slow. Looking at the experiment's
results show that most probes are very short (although this doesn't
tell us much about lookups of missing keys), so it's not that bad. For
the open addressing table with overflow list, we have:</p>

<pre class="example">
Probe length  Frequency (%)
 1             80.55
 2             12.77
 3              3.84
 4              1.49
 5              0.66
 6              0.32
 7              0.16
 8              0.09
 9              0.05
10              0.03
11              0.02
12              0.01
13              0.01
14              0.00
15              0.00
16              0.00
</pre>

<p>Still, as a comparison point, <em>2-left</em> hashing with 1/4 * 2^20 4-deep
buckets and an 8-entry overflow list achieves much better loads
(regular preallocated buckets are almost pitiful). Unlike the
theoretical setting, buckets have a bounded size (at most 4), so the
table uses 2^20 cells (+ the overflow list). The amount of space
allocated is much more interesting, but it also means that it will
take much fewer than 2^20 balls to have enough collisions to fill the
overflow list. Note that for the sequel, I'll always use the same
space budget: 2^20+8 key-value cells, whether they're arranged in
buckets or not. Load is always computed as the fraction of 2^20
balls that could be placed before hitting the probe length or bucket
size limits 8 times (enough to fill the overflow list). All the
statistics are aggregated from 1000 independent runs.</p>

<pre class="example">
           2-left, 4-buckets, 8-overflow
Load (%)  Frequency (%)
54           0
55          1.31
56         14.76
57         49.75
58         32.46
59          1.72
60           0
</pre>

<p>Bucket utilisation is also pretty good:</p>

<pre class="example">
Bucket size  Frequency (%)
0              1.90
1             13.39
2             42.50
3             38.38
4              3.83
</pre>

<p><em>2-left</em> hashing is clearly very interesting, even with preallocated
buckets; that's much more obvious here than with the previous
unbounded bucket experiment. Can we do better?</p>

<p>Having the choice of which table to use can clearly be very
effective. A similar trick can be used on linear open addressing
tables: split in two sub-tables, probe both sub-tables and stop as
soon as one of them has an empty slot (again, breaking ties
unfairly). I simulated such a scheme with 2 sub-tables of 1/2 * 2^20
cells, an 8-element overflow list, and maximal probe lengths of 8 and
16.</p>

<pre class="example">
           Probe: 8
Load (%)   Freq. (%)
52            0
53           0.51
54           4.18
55          18.33
56          34.83
57          31.16
58          10.29
59           0.71
60            0
</pre>

<pre class="example">
           Probe: 16
Load (%)   Freq. (%)
68            0
69           0.10
70           4.76
71          25.63
72          47.11
73          21.38
74           1.01
75            0
</pre>

<p>With a maximal probe length of 8, the <em>2-open</em> addressing table already
hits an expected load similar to that of <em>2-left</em> table.  When the
maximal length is pushed to 16, load is much better, and, again,
successful probes usually aren't very long: 98.9% of probes are of
length at most 4 (in both tables, meaning that at most 8 bins are
examined).</p>

<p>Allowing probes (of length greater than 1) has the advantage of
letting buckets overflow into adjacent ones, so that lightly loaded
buckets are better exploited in the rare cases when one
overflows. Deeper buckets, on the other hand, avoid the clustering
issues of linear open addressing; they're also slightly more
cache-friendly. When data is moved into cache, it's loaded a whole
cache line at a time. Linear addressing can exploit caches nicely
since it will probe consecutive addresses. However, there's no
guarantee that the probe will start at the beginning of the cache
line. If we take care to align buckets cache lines will be used more
efficiently.</p>

<p>Why not do both? Once we've settled on using multiple tables, short
probes and small preallocated buckets don't really make the code more
complex. For a first attempt, I simulated hash tables with 2
sub-tables, 4-deep buckets, up to 2, 3 or 4 -long probes and an
overflow list of at most 8 entries. So, an insertion will compute two
hash values to decide where to start probing, and insert in the least
loaded bucket (breaking ties as usual), continuing to the next bucket
in each table if both are empty. Load is pretty good, better than
<em>2-left</em> hashing:</p>

<pre class="example">
           2-probes
Load (%)   Freq. (%)
66           0
67          0.91
68         17.00
69         51.11
70         30.77
71          0.20
72           0
</pre>

<pre class="example">
           3-probes

72           0
73          0.20
74         10.82
75         53.79
76         34.78
77          0.40
78           0
</pre>

<pre class="example">
           4-probes

76           0
77          0.10
78         11.36

<p>The 2-table with 3-long probes and 4-deep buckets already performs
better than the 2-open table with 16-long probes while examining fewer
elements in the worst case. Longer probes on shallower buckets aren't
really an improvement; deeper buckets, on the other hand, are. With
8-deep buckets (but still the same space budget) and no open
addressing, we hit a load factor of ~78% (85% with probes of length up
to 2), and 90% for 16-deep buckets (open addressing isn't that
effective anymore). The problem with deeper buckets is that they take
more time to search (since they're usually nearly full), while the
vast majority of probes are of length 1 (&gt; 99% for the last three
parameter sets). Let's also keep in mind that we have to execute the
search on two sub-tables; searching among 16 elements <em>twice</em> adds up to
a substantial amount of work.</p>

<p>I've listed many possibilities. The following table recapitulates the
modal load factor for all the simulations above. Keep in mind that the
inverse, the space usage, is actually more relevant in practice. As
load values get closer to 1, the difference in space overhead becomes
smaller, so the 6% difference between <code>open(16)</code> without overflow and
<code>open(16)</code> is much more important than the 5% difference between
<code>2-combo(8,2)</code> and <code>2-left(16)</code>.</p>

<pre class="example">
Implementation   Modal load (%)
open(16) w/o OF      33         no overflow list
open(16)             39         16-probe at most
2-left(4)            57         4-buckets
2-open(8)            56         2 x 8-probe at most
2-open(16)           72
2-combo(4,2)         69         2-left, 4-buckets, 2-probes
2-combo(4,3)         75
2-combo(4,4)         79
2-left(8)            78
2-combo(8,2)         85
2-left(16)           90
</pre>

<p>Implementation-wise, 4-deep buckets are particularly interesting
because four 32-bit values (e.g. keys or hash values) are exactly the
size of an SSE register and can easily be searched in a single SSE
instruction. 16-deep buckets, on the other hand, usually fill cache
lines (often 64 bytes) exactly. 8-deep buckets still exploit cache
lines fairly well, without being too long to search in the common
case. Moreover, if we modify 2-combo(8, 2) so that probes always stay
in the same 64 bytes segment (probe bucket <code>i</code>, then <code>i xor 1</code>), the load
factor isn't affected (in simulations), but cache lines are used as
well as with 16-deep buckets. That's a nice bunch of interesting
structures to implement and test. I'll try and come back to the
topic with real timings in a couple posts.</p>
