<div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_data_structure">Implicit data structures</a>
are data structures with negligible space overhead compared to storing
the data in a flat array: auxiliary information is mostly represented
by permuting the elements cleverly.  For example, a sorted vector
combined with binary search is an implicit in-order representation of
a binary search tree.  I believe the seminal implicit data structure is
the binary heap of Williams and Floyd, usually presented in the
context of <a href="http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/heapSort.html">heapsort</a>.</p>

<p>I find most developers are vastly more comfortable dealing with
pointer-based data structures than with implicit ones.  I blame our
courses, which focus on the former and completely fail to show us how
to reason about the latter.  For example, the typical presentation of
the binary heap introduces an indexing scheme to map from parent to
children – the children of <code>heap[i]</code> are <code>heap[2 * i]</code> and
<code>heap[2 * i + 1]</code>, with one-based indices – that is hard to
generalise to ternary or k-ary heaps (Knuth’s presentation, with
parents at \(\lfloor i/2 \rfloor\), is no better).  The reason it’s
so hard to generalise is that the indexing scheme hides a simple
bijection between paths in k-way trees and natural numbers.</p>

<p>I find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc">ironic</a> that I
first encountered the idea of describing data structures or
algorithms in terms of number systems, through
<a href="http://okasaki.blogspot.com/2008/02/ten-years-of-purely-functional-data.html">Okasaki</a>’s
and <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/#R5">Hinze</a>’s
<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/bctcs-slides/hinze.pdf">work</a> on purely
functional data structures: that vantage point seems perfectly suited to
the archetypal mutable data structure, the array!  I’ll show how
number systems help us understand implicit data structures with two
examples: a simple indexing scheme for k-ary heaps and compositions of
specially structured permutations to implement in-place bit-reversal
and (some) matrix transpositions.</p>

<h1 id="simple-k-ary-max-heaps">Simple k-ary max heaps</h1>

<p><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms">The</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201000237">classical</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Algorithmics-Gilles-Brassard/dp/0133350681">way</a>
to present implicit binary heaps is to work with one-based array
indices and to root an implicit binary tree at <code>heap[1]</code>.  For any
node <code>heap[i]</code>, the children live at <code>heap[2 * i]</code> and
<code>heap[2 * i + 1]</code>.  My issue with this presentation is that it’s
unclear how to extend the scheme to ternary or k-ary trees: if the
children of <code>heap[1]</code> are <code>heap[3 * 1 ... 3 * 1 + 2]</code>, i.e.,
<code>heap[3, 4, 5]</code>,
what do we do with <code>heap[2]</code>?  We end up with <code>k - 1</code> parallel k-ary
trees stashed in the same array.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Volume-Searching/dp/0201896850">Knuth</a>’s choice of mapping children
to parents with a floored integer division suffers the same fate.</p>

<p>One-based arrays hides the beauty of the binary indexing scheme.  With
zero-based arrays, the children of <code>heap[i]</code> are <code>heap[2 * i + 1]</code> and
<code>heap[2 * i + 2]</code>.  This is clearly isomorphic to the one-based scheme
for binary heaps.  The difference is that the extension to k-way
trees is obvious: the children of <code>heap[i]</code> are <code>heap[k * i + 1 ... k * i + k]</code>.</p>

<p>A couple examples like the one below fail to show any problem.
However, even a large number of tests is no proof.  Thinking in terms
of number systems leads to a nice demonstration that the scheme
creates a bijection between infinite k-ary trees and the naturals.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014-04-13-number-systems-for-implicit-data-structures/5ary.png" /></p>

<p>There is a unique finite path from the root to any vertex in an
infinite k-ary tree.  This path can be described as a finite sequence
\((c\sb{1}, c\sb{2}, \ldots, c\sb{n})\) of integers between 1 and k
(inclusively).  If \(c\sb{1} = 1\), we first went down the first
child of the root node; if \(c\sb{1} = 2\), we instead went down the
second child; etc.  If \(c\sb{2} = 3\), we then went down the third
child, and so on.  We can recursively encode such finite paths as
naturals (in pidgin ML):</p>

<pre><code>path_to_nat [] = 0
path_to_nat [c : cs] = k * path_to_nat cs + c
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, this is an injection from finite paths in k-ary trees to the
naturals.  There’s only a tiny difference with the normal positional
encoding of naturals in base <code>k</code>: there is no 0, and digits instead
include <code>k</code>.  This prevents us from padding a path with zeros, which
would map multiple paths to the same natural.</p>

<p>We only have to show that <code>path_to_nat</code> is a bijection between finite
paths and naturals.  I’ll do that by constructing an inverse that is
total on the naturals.</p>

<pre><code>nat_to_path 0 = []
nat_to_path n = let c = pop n
                in c : nat_to_path (n - c) / k
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>pop</code> is a version of the <code>mod k</code> that returns <code>k</code> instead of 0:</p>

<pre><code>pop n = let c = n `mod` k
        in 
         if (c != 0)
          then c
          else k
</code></pre>

<p>The base case is <code>nat_to_path 0 = []</code>.</p>

<p>In the induction step, we can assume that <code>path_to_nat cs = n</code> and
that <code>nat_to_path n = cs</code>.  We only have to show that, for any
\(1 \leq c \leq k\), <code>nat_to_path path_to_nat c:cs = c:cs</code>.  Let 
<code>n' = path_to_nat c:cs = k * n + c</code>.</p>

<p>\[n\sp{\prime} = kn + c \equiv c\quad \mod k,\]
so <code>pop n'</code> will correctly return <code>c</code> (and <code>k</code> rather than 0).  It’s
then a tiny bit of algebra to show that <code>(n' - c) / k = n</code>, and we
fall back to the induction hypothesis.</p>

<p>This scheme is so simple that I wound up coding a version of
<code>heapsort(3)</code> that lets callers choose the heap’s arity at runtime.
Higher arity heaps perform more comparisons but fewer swaps than
binary heaps; the tradeoff is profitable when sorting large items.
It seems to me that, for decades, we’ve been presenting implicit heaps
and heapsort in a way that marginally simplifies the binary case at
the expense of obscuring the elegant general case.</p>

<h1 id="array-permutations-as-algebra-on-positional-number-systems">Array permutations as algebra on positional number systems</h1>

<p>Bit reversing an array of length \(2\sp{l}\) sends the element <code>x[i]</code> to
<code>x[j]</code>, where the binary representation of <code>i</code> (including padding up
to <code>l</code> bits) is the reverse of <code>j</code>.  For example, in an array of
length 16, <code>3 = 0011</code> becomes <code>1100 = 12</code>.</p>

<p>Reversing a fixed-width integer’s binary representation is its
self-inverse, so bit reversing an array is a sequence of swaps.  This
means that the permutation can be performed in-place, as a series of
independent swaps.  Bit reversal used to be slow on cached machines:
contiguous elements (with indices that only vary in their low order
bits) swap with far-off elements (indices that only vary in their high
order bits).  Worse, the stride between the latter elements is a large
power of two, which causes all sorts of aliasing issues.  Workarounds
(see
<a href="http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~zzhang/publications/tr99-sc-bitrev.pdf">Zhang 99 (PDF)</a>)
mostly end up implementing a software cache with explicit buffers.
Nowadays, even L1 caches have such a high associativity that aliasing
is a much less important issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/Napa-FFT3">Napa-FFT3</a> implements bit
reversals by calling a few specialised functions that only swap the
lower and higher bits; the main routine iterates over an array of
precomputed middle bit reversals (similar to
<a href="http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~elster/pubs/">various publications of Elster’s</a>,
but recursing on the middle bits first).  In this implementation, the
number of L1 cache misses incurred by bit reversing an array is only
slightly greater than the compulsory misses.  Bit reversal isn’t free,
but it’s also not clear that autosorting FFTs are quicker than
out-of-order FFTs followed by a bit reversal pass.</p>

<p>Bit reversal is the only array permutation I’ve seen described in
terms of its effect on indices.  I think it’s a fruitful avenue for
other in-place permutations.</p>

<p>For example, the viewpoint makes it clear how to transpose a matrix of
dimensions \(2\sp{m} \times 2\sp{n}\) with a sequence of in-place
bit reversals (each \(i\sb{k}\) and \(j\sb{l}\) is a bit in the
index’s binary representation).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014-04-13-number-systems-for-implicit-data-structures/bit-reverse-transpose.jpg" /></p>

<p>For a row-major layout, the sketch above corresponds to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>bit reverse each row of length \(2\sp{n}\) in place;</li>
  <li>bit reverse the whole vector of length \(2\sp{m + n}\) in place;</li>
  <li>bit reverse each new row of length \(2\sp{m}\) in place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bit reversal, like all other permutations, is a reversible linear
operation. We can thus change the order of operation if we want to.
For example, it’s not necessarily preferable to bit-reverse contiguous
rows first.  We could also flip the high-order bits of the indices:
rather than swapping scalars, we would swap rows.  Separately bit
reversing contiguous rows works best when each row fits in cache.  Bit
reversing columns instead amortises the bad access pattern inherent to
bit reversal by spending more time on each swap: swapping rows is
slower than swapping scalars, but also very efficients with regards to
(streaming!) I/O.</p>

<p>This is interesting because in-place transposition of rectangular
matrices is hard, and transposition is already a bad fit for caches.
Transposing matrices with a sequence of bit reversals might just be
practical.  In fact, that’s what I intend to do in Napa-FFT3 for
multi-dimensional DFTs: we can fuse all but the middle whole-vector
bit reversal with mixed-radix FFTs (and the latter might similarly
benefit from operating on [sub-]rows rather than scalars).</p>

<p>One obvious question now appears: can we generalise the trick to
general dimensions?  It’s pretty clear that we can do it for any other
base \(b\) and matrices of dimension \(b\sp{m} \times b\sp{n}\)
(it’s interesting how highly composite numbers dimensions are easy to
transpose, and, IIRC, so are coprime ones).  What if there’s no such
factorisation?  The best I can do is “more or less.”</p>

<p>For arbitrary matrix dimensions \(m \times n\), I think it’s best to
decompose indices in a mixed radix (but still positional) number
system.  For example, a \(63 \times 21\) matrix might have indices in
radix \(3,7\ |\ 3,7,3\).  Given this number system, matrix
transposition is</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014-04-13-number-systems-for-implicit-data-structures/concrete-mixed-radix.jpg" /></p>

<p>It’s a small generalisation to let the radices be \(a,b\ |\ a,b,a\),
for a matrix of dimension \(ab \times a\sp{2}b\).  We can then
perform most of a matrix transposition by swapping positions of
identical weight: first a full mixed-radix digit reversal (the weights
are palindromic), followed by another mixed-radix reversal on the
first three positions.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014-04-13-number-systems-for-implicit-data-structures/general-mixed-radix.jpg" /></p>

<p>This leaves the last chunk \(b\sb{2},a\sb{3}\), which should instead
be \(a\sb{3},b\sb{2}\).  That’s another rectangular matrix tranpose,
but smaller than the original one.  It might be practical to execute
that last step with a straightforward out-of-place transpose: a
smaller transpose needs less scratch space and may fit in cache.  We
can also apply the same trick as for bit reversals and apply the
transpose before everything else, by permuting rows rather than
scalars.  The simplest way to do that is to transpose a matrix of
pointers before replicating the permutation on the actual data
(glibc’s mergesort references Knuth vol. 3, exercise
5.2-10).</p>

<p>Finally, this also works for \(a\sp{2}b \times ab\): matrix
transposition is its own inverse, so we only have execute the inverse
of each step, in reverse order.</p>

<p>Definitely mixed results, but at least we have some intuition on why
general rectangular transpositions are hard to perform in place:
they’re hard to express as sequences of swaps.</p>

<h1 id="next-c-code-and-cycle-counts">Next: C code and cycle counts!</h1>

<p>This post is the more theoretical prologue to
<a href="/Blog/2014/04/13/k-ary-heapsort/">a low-level look</a>
at <code>qsort(3)</code>: I really wanted to make sure the nice implicit tree
layout in the first section had the space it deserves.</p>

<p>I tried to make in-order implicit trees fit in this number system
approach. I can’t see how.  The problem is that in-order trees
associate ranges (rather than indices) with nodes; for example, at
what depth is index 1000? It depends on the size of the search
tree. It might be the root (in a tree of 2000 vertices) or a leaf (in
a tree of 1001 vertices).</p>
